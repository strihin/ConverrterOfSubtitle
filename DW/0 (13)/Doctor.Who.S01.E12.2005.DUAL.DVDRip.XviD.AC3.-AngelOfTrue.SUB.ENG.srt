00:20:11,727 --> 00:20:13,126
No, I can't.

328
00:20:13,207 --> 00:20:15,562
Lynda, you're sweet.
From what I've seen of your world,

329
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:18,036
do you think anybody votes for sweet?

330
00:20:28,807 --> 00:20:31,560
Hold on. I've been here before.

331
00:20:32,407 --> 00:20:34,238
This is Satellite Five.

332
00:20:40,887 --> 00:20:43,037
No guards, makes a change.

333
00:20:43,127 --> 00:20:46,119
You'd think a big business like Satellite Five
would be armed to the teeth.

334
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,959
No one's called it Satellite Five in ages.

335
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:51,596
It's the Game Station now.
Hasn't been Satellite Five in about 1 00 years.

336
00:20:51,967 --> 00:20:55,801
1 00 years exactly. It's the year 2001 00.

337
00:20:56,087 --> 00:20:58,521
I was here before, Floor 1 39.

338
00:20:58,647 --> 00:21:01,559
The Satellite was broadcasting
news channels back then.

339
00:21:02,247 --> 00:21:04,477
Had a bit of trouble upstairs. Nothing too serious.

340
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:07,684
Easy, gave them a hand, home in time for tea.

341
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:12,843
Hundred years ago?
What? You were here 1 00 years ago?

342
00:21:12,927 --> 00:21:14,121
Yes.

343
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:15,999
Well, you're looking good on it.

344
00:21:16,487 --> 00:21:17,966
I moisturise.

345
00:21:18,407 --> 00:21:22,286
Funny sorts of readings.
All kinds of energy. Place is humming.

346
00:21:22,367 --> 00:21:25,484
It's weird, this goes way beyond
normal transmissions.

347
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:27,444
What would they need all that power for?

348
00:21:27,527 --> 00:21:31,805
I don't know. I think we're the first
ever contestants to get outside.

349
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:34,159
I had two friends with me,

350
00:21:34,247 --> 00:21:36,681
they must have got caught in the transmat.
Where would they be?

351
00:21:36,767 --> 00:21:38,723
I don't know,
they could have been allocated anywhere.

352
00:21:38,807 --> 00:21:40,399
There's 1 00 different games.

353
00:21:40,687 --> 00:21:42,166
Like what?

354
00:21:42,247 --> 00:21:44,442
There's 1 0 floors of Big Brother,
there's a different house

355
00:21:44,527 --> 00:21:47,837
behind each of these doors, and then
beyond that there's all sorts of shows.

356
00:21:47,927 --> 00:21:51,442
It's nonstop. There's Call My Bluff, with real guns.

357
00:21:51,527 --> 00:21:55,315
Countdown, where you got 30 seconds
to stop the bomb going off.

358
00:21:55,407 --> 00:21:59,798
Ground Force, which is a nasty one.
You get turned into compost.

359
00:22:00,007 --> 00:22:01,645
Wipeout, speaks for itself.

360
00:22:01,807 --> 00:22:05,516
Oh, and Stars In Their Eyes, literally,
stars in their eyes.

361
00:22:05,607 --> 00:22:08,167
If you don't sing, you get blinded.

362
00:22:08,247 --> 00:22:09,885
And you watch this stuff?

363
00:22:09,967 --> 00:22:12,003
Everyone does. How come you don't?

364
00:22:12,087 --> 00:22:13,440
Never paid for my licence.

365
00:22:13,527 --> 00:22:16,325
Oh, my God, you get executed for that.

366
00:22:16,407 --> 00:22:17,840
Let them try.

367
00:22:18,567 --> 00:22:20,922
You keep saying things that don't make sense.

368
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:22,963
Who are you, though, Doctor, really?

369
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:25,645
It doesn't matter.

370
00:22:26,327 --> 00:22:29,046
Well, it does to me.
I've just put my life in your hands.

371
00:22:29,127 --> 00:22:33,678
I'm just a traveller wandering past.
Believe it or not, all I'm after is a quiet life.

372
00:22:33,767 --> 00:22:38,477
So, if we get out of here, what are you
going to do? Just wander off again?

373
00:22:38,647 --> 00:22:40,285
As fast as I can.

374
00:22:40,727 --> 00:22:43,878
'Cause, erm...I could come with you.

375
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:49,922
-Maybe you could.
-I wouldn't get in the way.

376
00:22:50,007 --> 00:22:53,682
I wouldn't mind if you did.
Not a bad idea, Lynda with a ''Y''.

377
00:22:55,847 --> 00:22:58,805
But first of all, we've got to concentrate
on the getting out.

378
00:22:58,927 --> 00:23:02,237
To do that, you've got to know your enemy.
Who's controlling it?

379
00:23:02,327 --> 00:23:04,602
Who's in charge of the Satellite now?

380
00:23:04,687 --> 00:23:05,881
Hold on.

381
00:23:10,167 --> 00:23:12,727
Your lords and masters.

382
00:23:19,967 --> 00:23:22,959
Okay, you win, the Controller's got to handle this.

383
00:23:23,047 --> 00:23:25,800
Archive makes a record of all transmat activities.

384
00:23:25,887 --> 00:23:27,525
Find out how he got on board.

385
00:23:27,607 --> 00:23:29,325
Archive 6.

386
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:55,844
Controller, we have a problem.

387
00:23:56,487 --> 00:23:58,159
Continue working.

388
00:23:58,447 --> 00:24:00,039
We have a security problem.

389
00:24:00,127 --> 00:24:01,765
Continue working.

390
00:24:03,927 --> 00:24:07,681
I'm sorry, but I can't.
We have contestants outside of the games.

391
00:24:07,767 --> 00:24:09,359
But the alarms haven't gone off.

392
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:11,722
No security, the games continue.

393
00:24:12,247 --> 00:24:13,999
But we can't just let them wander.

394
00:24:14,087 --> 00:24:15,725
They are no one.

395
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:19,526
They are no one.

396
00:24:24,127 --> 00:24:26,516
I'm sorry, I was just....

397
00:24:26,607 --> 00:24:28,438
Archive 6 is out of bounds.

398
00:24:28,527 --> 00:24:30,040
I need to check the transmat log.

399
00:24:30,127 --> 00:24:34,837
Archive 6 is out of bounds.
No one may enter Archive 6. Return to work.

400
00:24:41,007 --> 00:24:42,679
Return to work.

401
00:24:44,487 --> 00:24:48,446
Inform all staff, solar flares in Delta .7.

402
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:50,444
(MURMURING)

403
00:24:53,887 --> 00:24:57,766
Compatible systems, just align the wave signature.

404
00:24:58,687 --> 00:25:00,200
Attaboy!

405
00:25:00,287 --> 00:25:04,405
Got myself a gun.
Well, ladies, the pleasure was all mine,

406
00:25:04,487 --> 00:25:06,876
which is the only thing that matters in the end.

407
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:17,681
Two hearts, that's him. Which floor?

408
00:25:23,847 --> 00:25:28,875
Blimey! I've never seen it for real before,
not from orbit.

409
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:31,040
Planet Earth!

410
00:25:31,127 --> 00:25:32,640
What's happened to it?

411
00:25:32,727 --> 00:25:35,605
It's always been like that,
ever since I was born. See that there?

412
00:25:35,687 --> 00:25:38,281
That's the Great Atlantic Smog Storm,
it's been going 20 years.

413
00:25:38,367 --> 00:25:41,040
We get newsflashes telling us when
it's safe to breathe outside.

414
00:25:41,127 --> 00:25:44,278
So the population just sits there?
Half the world's too fat

415
00:25:44,367 --> 00:25:46,722
and half the world's too thin
and you lot just watch telly?

416
00:25:46,807 --> 00:25:49,162
1 0,000 channels. All beaming down from here.

417
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:52,956
The human race.
Brainless sheep, being fed on a diet of....

418
00:25:53,047 --> 00:25:56,483
Have they still got that programme
where three people have to live with a bear?

419
00:25:56,567 --> 00:25:58,080
Bear With Me! I love that!

420
00:25:58,167 --> 00:26:00,397
The celebrity edition
where the bear got in the bath.

421
00:26:00,487 --> 00:26:03,797
But it's all gone wrong.
I mean, history's gone wrong. Again!

422
00:26:03,967 --> 00:26:06,606
This should be the Fourth Great
and Bountiful Human Empire.

423
00:26:06,687 --> 00:26:09,565
I don't understand.
Last time I was here I put it right.

424
00:26:09,967 --> 00:26:12,322
No, but that's when it first went wrong.
1 00 years ago.

425
00:26:12,407 --> 00:26:16,559
Like you said, all the news channels,
they just shut down overnight.

426
00:26:17,687 --> 00:26:20,121
But that was me. I did that.

427
00:26:20,207 --> 00:26:22,482
There was nothing left in their place.
No information.

428
00:26:22,567 --> 00:26:26,276
The whole planet just froze.
The government, the economy, they collapsed.

429
00:26:26,487 --> 00:26:30,400
That was the start of it. 1 00 years of hell.

430
00:26:30,487 --> 00:26:31,761
Oh, my....

431
00:26:36,047 --> 00:26:37,719
I made this world.

432
00:26:45,007 --> 00:26:49,239
<i>That leaves Rose and Roderick.</i>
<i>You're going head-to-head.</i>

433
00:26:49,967 --> 00:26:52,242
<i>Let's play The Weakest Link!</i>

434
00:26:52,847 --> 00:26:56,396
Right, that's the end of tactical voting.
You're on your own now.

435
00:26:59,047 --> 00:27:02,164
<i>(JACK) Hey, handsome, good to see you.</i>
<i>Any sign of Rose?</i>

436
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:03,521
Can't you track her down?

437
00:27:03,607 --> 00:27:06,440
She must still be inside the games.
All the rooms are shielded.

438
00:27:06,527 --> 00:27:09,485
If I can just get inside this computer.
She's got to be here somewhere.

439
00:27:09,567 --> 00:27:11,876
You'd better hurry up,
these games don't have a happy ending.

440
00:27:11,967 --> 00:27:14,481
You think I don't know that?

441
00:27:14,847 --> 00:27:18,203
There you go, patch that in.
It's programmed to find her.

442
00:27:18,287 --> 00:27:19,845
-Thanks.
-Hey, there.

443
00:27:19,927 --> 00:27:21,645
-Hello.
-Captain Jack Harkness.

444
00:27:21,767 --> 00:27:23,803
-Lynda Moss.
-Nice to meet you, Lynda Moss.

445
00:27:23,887 --> 00:27:25,957
-Do you mind flirting outside?
-I was just saying hello.

446
00:27:26,047 --> 00:27:27,241
For you, that's flirting.

447
00:27:27,327 --> 00:27:29,363
-I'm not complaining.
-Muchas gracias.

448
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:32,484
It's not compatible.
This stupid system doesn't make sense.

449
00:27:35,527 --> 00:27:39,918
This place should be a basic broadcaster.
But the systems are twice as complicated.

450
00:27:40,007 --> 00:27:43,044
It's more than just television.
This station's transmitting something else.

451
00:27:43,127 --> 00:27:44,685
-Like what?
-I don't know.

452
00:27:44,767 --> 00:27:46,962
This whole Bad Wolf thing's tied up with me.

453
00:27:47,047 --> 00:27:51,359
Someone's manipulated my entire life.
It's some sort of trap and Rose is stuck inside it.

454

<i>-You will be transported home with 1,600 credits.</i>
-I need to find the Doctor!

492
00:30:21,927 --> 00:30:24,600
-He wouldn't just leave me!
-Thank you so much.

493
00:30:24,687 --> 00:30:27,247
This game is illegal, I'm telling you to stop!

494
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:30,399
Rose! Stop this game.
I order you to stop this game!

495
00:30:30,487 --> 00:30:34,446
<i>-You are the Weakest link.</i>
-Look out for the Anne Droid, it's armed!

496
00:30:49,207 --> 00:30:51,277
Back off!

497
00:30:51,447 --> 00:30:55,281
I need security and I need it here right now!

498
00:30:56,367 --> 00:30:59,200
-It's this lot.
-Don't you touch him! Leave him alone!

499
00:30:59,287 --> 00:31:01,926
Sir, put down the gun or I'll have to shoot.

500
00:31:02,247 --> 00:31:04,078
You killed her!

501
00:31:04,167 --> 00:31:06,920
Your stupid freaking game show killed her!

502
00:31:07,007 --> 00:31:11,159
Sir, I'm arresting you under
Private Legislation 1 6 of the Game Station....

503
00:31:28,047 --> 00:31:30,402
Can you tell us the purpose of this device, sir?

504
00:31:30,487 --> 00:31:32,921
Can you tell us how you got on board?

505
00:31:33,007 --> 00:31:34,759
Just leave him alone.

506
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:37,158
I'm asking him.

507
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:42,727
Sir? Can you tell us who you are?

508
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,046
You will be taken from this place
to the Lunar Penal Colony,

509
00:31:52,127 --> 00:31:55,358
there to be held without trial.
You may not appeal against this sentence.

510
00:31:58,087 --> 00:31:59,964
Is that understood?

511
00:32:06,647 --> 00:32:08,080
Let's do it.

512
00:32:20,167 --> 00:32:22,044
Oh, my God, now we're in trouble.

513
00:32:23,647 --> 00:32:24,875
Floor 500.

514
00:32:27,047 --> 00:32:30,881
Clear the floor!
He's on his way up here. With a gun!

515
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,676
This is an emergency,
you've got to close down the lift.

516
00:32:38,767 --> 00:32:39,995
All staff are reminded that solar flares....

517
00:32:40,087 --> 00:32:42,681
Never mind the solar flares, he's gonna kill you!

518
00:32:45,687 --> 00:32:49,646
Okay, move away from the desk.
Nobody try anything clever.

519
00:32:49,727 --> 00:32:53,197
Everybody clear, stand to the side and stay there.

520
00:32:53,287 --> 00:32:55,039
Who's in charge of this place?

521
00:32:55,127 --> 00:32:57,641
-This Satellite is more than a Game Station.
-...79, 80....

522
00:32:57,727 --> 00:33:02,164
-Who killed Rose Tyler? I want an answer.
-All staff are reminded that....

523
00:33:02,247 --> 00:33:04,124
She can't reply. Don't shoot!

524
00:33:04,207 --> 00:33:06,482
Don't be so thick, like I was ever gonna shoot.

525
00:33:06,647 --> 00:33:08,285
Captain, we've got more guards on the way up.

526
00:33:08,367 --> 00:33:09,436
-Secure the exits.
-Yes, sir!

527
00:33:09,527 --> 00:33:10,926
You! What were you saying?

528
00:33:11,127 --> 00:33:14,119
-But I've got your gun.
-Okay, so shoot me. Why can't she answer?

529
00:33:14,207 --> 00:33:16,357
She's.... Can I put this down?

530
00:33:16,447 --> 00:33:18,517
-If you want, just hurry up.
-Thanks.

531
00:33:18,607 --> 00:33:22,520
Sorry. The Controller
is linked into the transmissions.

532
00:33:22,607 --> 00:33:24,484
The entire output goes through her brain.

533
00:33:24,567 --> 00:33:27,445
You're not a member of staff
so she doesn't recognise your existence.

534
00:33:27,527 --> 00:33:29,199
-What's her name?
-I don't know.

535
00:33:29,287 --> 00:33:32,518
She was installed when she was five.
It's the only life she's ever known.

536
00:33:32,607 --> 00:33:34,882
Doors sealed.
We should be safe for about 1 0 minutes.

537
00:33:34,967 --> 00:33:38,243
-Keep an eye on them.
-What you were saying about the Game Station,

538
00:33:38,327 --> 00:33:40,204
I think you're right. I've kept a log.

539
00:33:40,287 --> 00:33:43,836
Unauthorised transmits, encrypted signals,
it's been going on for years.

540
00:33:43,927 --> 00:33:44,962
Show me.

541
00:33:45,047 --> 00:33:47,720
You're not allowed in there.
Archive 6 is out of bounds.

542
00:33:47,807 --> 00:33:50,241
Do I look like an out of bounds sort of guy?

543
00:34:16,527 --> 00:34:18,040
What the hell?

544
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:24,677
Solar flare activity in Delta .01 5.

545
00:34:24,807 --> 00:34:28,038
If you're not holding us hostage then let us out.
The staff are terrified.

546
00:34:28,127 --> 00:34:30,595
That's the same staff who execute
hundreds of contestants every day?

547
00:34:30,687 --> 00:34:32,200
We're just doing our jobs.

548
00:34:32,287 --> 00:34:35,723
And with that sentence you just lost the right
to even talk to me, now back off!

549
00:34:40,007 --> 00:34:43,079
That's just the solar flares.
They interfere with the broadcast signal

550
00:34:43,167 --> 00:34:45,397
so this place automatically powers down.

551
00:34:45,487 --> 00:34:48,957
Planet Earth gets a few repeats.
It's all quite normal.

552
00:34:49,167 --> 00:34:50,441
Doctor....

553
00:34:50,687 --> 00:34:52,837
-Doctor?
-Whatever it is, you can wait.

554
00:34:52,927 --> 00:34:54,679
I think she wants you.

555
00:34:54,767 --> 00:34:58,965
Doctor. Doctor. Where's the Doctor?

556
00:34:59,207 --> 00:35:00,435
I'm here.

557
00:35:00,527 --> 00:35:03,724
Can't see. Blind, so blind.

558
00:35:03,807 --> 00:35:07,482
All my life blind, all I can see is numbers.
But I saw you.

559
00:35:07,567 --> 00:35:11,003
-What do you want?
-Solar flares hiding me, they can't hear me.

560
00:35:11,087 --> 00:35:14,318
My Masters listen but they can't hear me now.
The sun is so bright.

561
00:35:14,407 --> 00:35:16,204
Who are your masters?

562
00:35:16,327 --> 00:35:20,161
They wired my head, the name's forbidden.
They control my thoughts.

563
00:35:20,247 --> 00:35:22,715
My Masters, I had to be careful.

564
00:35:22,807 --> 00:35:25,765
They monitor transmission
but they don't watch the programmes.

565
00:35:25,847 --> 00:35:28,281
I could hide you in the games.
I knew that you'd find me.

566
00:35:28,367 --> 00:35:30,119
My friend died inside your games.

567
00:35:30,207 --> 00:35:32,118
-Doesn't matter.
-Don't dare tell me that!

568
00:35:32,207 --> 00:35:35,722
They've been hiding.
My Masters, hiding in the dark space.

569
00:35:35,807 --> 00:35:39,766
Watching and shaping the Earth, so many years.

570
00:35:40,527 --> 00:35:44,440
Always been there, guiding humanity.
Hundreds and hundreds of years.

571
00:35:44,527 --> 00:35:45,755
Who are they?

572
00:35:45,847 --> 00:35:48,361
They wait and plan and grow in numbers,
they're strong now.

573
00:35:48,447 --> 00:35:50,722
-So strong, my Masters....
-Who are they?

574
00:35:50,807 --> 00:35:54,117
But speak of you, my Masters,
they fear the Doctor....

575
00:35:54,207 --> 00:35:56,641
Tell me, who are they?

576
00:35:59,367 --> 00:36:00,959
(MURMURING)

577
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:04,280
When's the next solar flare?

578
00:36:04,367 --> 00:36:06,358
-Two years' time.
-Fat lot of good that is!

579
00:36:06,447 --> 00:36:08,563
-Found the Tardis.
-We're not leaving now.

580
00:36:08,647 --> 00:36:13,004
No, but the Tardis worked it out.
You'll wanna watch this.

581
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:15,203
Lynda, could you stand over there for me, please?

582
00:36:15,287 --> 00:36:16,845
I just want to go home.

583
00:36:16,927 --> 00:36:20,476
It'll only take a second. Could you stand
in that spot? Quick as you can.

584
00:36:20,567 --> 00:36:24,845
Everybody watching? Okay, 3, 2, 1 .

585
00:36:30,007 --> 00:36:32,646
-But you killed her.
-Oh? Do you think?

586
00:36:37,367 --> 00:36:39,164
What the hell was that?

587
00:36:39,247 --> 00:36:41,807
It's a transmat beam. Not a disintegrator.

588
00:36:41,887 --> 00:36:45,766
A secondary transmat system.
People don't get killed in the games.

589
00:36:45,847 --> 00:36:49,886
They get transported across space.
Doctor, Rose is still alive!

590
00:37:03,967 --> 00:37:06,003
No. It can't be....

591
00:37:07,127 --> 00:37:09,800
You're dead. I saw you die!

592
00:37:13,767 --> 00:37:17,442
-She's out there somewhere.
-Doctor! Coordinates 5.6.1 .

593
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:19,438
Don't! The solar flare's gone, they'll hear you!

594
00:37:19,527 --> 00:37:22,963
...4 34.
No, my Masters, no, I defy you!

595
00:37:23,047 --> 00:37:25,686
Sigma 77.... (SCREAMS)

596
00:37:27,687 --> 00:37:29,439
They took her.

597
00:37:48,327 --> 00:37:49,965
My Masters.

598
00:37:51,527 --> 00:37:55,520
You can kill me.
For I have brought your destruction.

599
00:38:01,847 --> 00:38:04,122
Use that, it might contain the final numbers.

600
00:38:04,207 --> 00:38:06,596
I kept a log of all the unscheduled transmissions.

601
00:38:06,687 --> 00:38:10,965
Nice, thanks. Captain Jack Harkness, by the way.

602
00:38:11,047 --> 00:38:13,880
-I'm Davitch Pavale.
-Nice to meet you, Davitch Pavale.

603
00:38:13,967 --> 00:38:15,480
There's a time and a place.

604
00:38:15,567 --> 00:38:18,286
Are you saying this whole setup's been
a disguise all along?

605
00:38:18,487 --> 00:38:21,479
Going way back.
Installing the Jagrafess 1 00 years ago.

606
00:38:21,647 --> 00:38:23,717
Someone's been playing a long game.

607
00:38:23,807 --> 00:38:27,163
Controlling the human race
from behind the scenes for generations.

608
00:38:27,247 --> 00:38:28,965
Click on this.

609
00:38:32,487 --> 00:38:36,321
The transmat delivers to that point,
right on the edge of the solar system.

610
00:38:36,407 --> 00:38:37,886
There's nothing there.

611
00:38:37,967 --> 00:38:41,004
It looks like nothing
because that's what this Satellite does!

612
00:38:41,087 --> 00:38:43,555
Underneath the transmission,
there's another signal.

613
00:38:43,647 --> 00:38:46,559
-Doing what?
-Hiding whatever's out there.

614
00:38:46,647 --> 00:38:48,956
Hiding it from sonar, radar, scanners.

615
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:52,446
There's something sitting
right on top of planet Earth

616
00:38:52,527 --> 00:38:54,722
but it's completely invisible.

617
00:38:54,807 --> 00:38:57,037
If I cancel the signal....

618
00:39:14,087 --> 00:39:17,238
That's impossible. I know those ships.

619
00:39:17,767 --> 00:39:19,485
They were destroyed.

620
00:39:20,487 --> 00:39:22,205
Obviously they survived.

621
00:39:22,287 --> 00:39:24,039
Who did? Who are they?

622
00:39:24,127 --> 00:39:28,484
200 ships. More than 2,000 on board each one.

623
00:39:28,567 --> 00:39:30,558
That's just about half a million of them.

624
00:39:30,647 --> 00:39:32,444
Half a million what?

625
00:39:32,527 --> 00:39:33,960
Daleks.

626
00:39:34,847 --> 00:39:38,317
<i>Alert. Alert. We are detected!</i>

627
00:39:38,407 --> 00:39:43,925
<i>It Is the Doctor! He has located us.</i>
<i>0pen communications channel.</i>

628
00:39:44,527 --> 00:39:48,520
<i>The female will stand. Stand!</i>

629
00:39:55,207 --> 00:39:57,562
<i>I will talk to the Doctor.</i>

630
00:39:58,007 --> 00:40:00,043
Oh, will you? That's nice. Hello.

631
00:40:00,127 --> 00:40:05,042
<i>The Dalek Stratagem nears completion.</i>
<i>The Fleet Is almost ready.</i>

632
00:40:05,127 --> 00:40:07,038
<i>You will not intervene.</i>

633
00:40:07,367 --> 00:40:08,925
Oh, really? Why's that, then?

634
00:40:09,007 --> 00:40:11,202
<i>We have your associate.</i>

635
00:40:12,167 --> 00:40:15,921
<i>You will obey or she will be exterminated.</i>

636
00:40:18,247 --> 00:40:19,600
No.

637
00:40:25,287 --> 00:40:27,357
<i>Explain yourself.</i>

638
00:40:27,607 --> 00:40:29,120
I said, no.

639
00:40:29,567 --> 00:40:32,081
<i>What Is the meaning of this negative?</i>

640
00:40:32,167 --> 00:40:33,600
It means no.

641
00:40:33,687 --> 00:40:35,723
<i>But she will be destroyed!</i>

642
00:40:35,887 --> 00:40:40,597
No, 'cause this is what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna rescue her.

643
00:40:40,687 --> 00:40:43,485
I'm gonna save Rose Tyler
from the middle of the Dalek Fleet.

644
00:40:43,567 --> 00:40:46,798
And then I'm gonna save the Earth.
And then, just to finish off,

645
00:40:46,887 --> 00:40:50,880
I'm gonna wipe every last stinking Dalek
out of the sky!

646
00:40:50,967 --> 00:40:55,324
<i>But you have no weapons! No defences! No plan!</i>

647
00:40:55,407 --> 00:40:58,922
Yeah. And doesn't that scare you to death?

648
00:40:59,647 --> 00:41:00,716
Rose?

649
00:41:00,807 --> 00:41:02,081
Yes, Doctor?

650
00:41:02,167 --> 00:41:03,998
<i>I'm coming to get you.</i>

651
00:41:04,767 --> 00:41:07,679
<i>The Doctor Is Initiating hostile action.</i>

652
00:41:07,807 --> 00:41:13,040
<i>The Stratagem must advance.</i>
<i>Begin the Invasion of Earth.</i>

653
00:41:13,127 --> 00:41:15,561
<i>The Doctor will be exterminated.</i>

654
00:41:15,647 --> 00:41:19,356
<i>(ALL) Exterminate. Exterminate.. ..</i>

655
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:30,166
<i>Launch missiles. Exterminate.</i>

656
00:41:31,287 --> 00:41:35,439
We've got incoming. This is it,
ladies and gentlemen, we are at war.

00:41:35,767 --> 00:41:38,725
(JACK) <i>There's an army</i>
<i>about to Invade this station.</i>

00:41:39,767 --> 00:41:40,995

00:41:41,087 --> 00:41:44,921
I'm dead, or about to die any second,
with no chance of escape.

660
00:41:57,527 --> 00:41:59,483
How did you survive the Time War?

661
00:41:59,567 --> 00:42:02,400
<i>They survived through me.</i>
