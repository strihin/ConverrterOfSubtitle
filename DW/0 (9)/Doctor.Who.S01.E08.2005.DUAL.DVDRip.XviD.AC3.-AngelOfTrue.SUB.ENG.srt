00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:57,309
Asked her for a date?

340
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:01,066
-Wrote his number on my hand.
-Never got rid of her since.

341
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:02,742
My dad said....

342
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:11,623
I don't know what this is all about
and I know we're not important....

343
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,302
Who said you're not important?

344
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:19,263
I've travelled to all sorts of places,
done things you couldn't even imagine.

345
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:20,979
But you two.

346
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:27,027
Street corner, 2:00 in the morning,
getting a taxi home.

347
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:30,582
I've never had a life like that.

348
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,388
Yes.

349
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,062
I'll try and save you.

350
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:41,506
I'm a dad.

351
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,023
I mean, I'm already a dad

352
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:46,659
but Rose grows up and she's you.

353
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:48,978
That's wonderful.

354
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,823
I mean, I suppose I thought
that you'd be a bit useless

355
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:54,424
what with my useless genes
and all but....

356
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,865
Well, I mean, how did you get here?

357
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,668
-Do you really want to know?
-Yeah.

358
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,748
A time machine.

359
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:05,541
-Time machine?
-Cross my heart.

360
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:08,144
Do you all have time machines
where you come from?

361
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,743
No, just the Doctor.

362
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:12,865
Did you know these things were coming?

363
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:14,665
No.

364
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:17,865
God, I don't know, my head's spinning.

365
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,824
What's the future like?

366
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,548
It's not so different.

367
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,825
What am I like? Have I gone grey?

368
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:35,507
Have I gone bald?
Don't tell me I've gone bald.

369
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:44,420
So, if this mate of yours isn't your
boyfriend, and I have to say I'm glad

370
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:47,502
'cause being your dad and all,
I think he's a bit old for you.

371
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,585
-Have you got a bloke?
-No. I did have.

372
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:52,183
(MUM) Mickey.

373
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:58,021
Do you know him?

374
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:01,859
I just didn't recognise him in a suit.
You have to let go of me, sweetheart.

375
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,144
I'm always saying that.

376
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:06,302
He just grabs hold of what's passing
and holds on for dear life.

377
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:08,904
God help his poor girlfriend
if he ever gets one.

378
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:11,788
-Me and Rose were just talking.
-Oh, yeah? Talking?

379
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:14,145
While the world comes to an end,
what do you do?

380
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:16,061
Cling to the youngest blonde.

381
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,309
Come on, Mick.

382
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:24,661
-You can't tell her.
-Why?

383
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,025
I mean,
I really don't want you to tell her.

384
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:29,385
-You don't want people to know?
-Where I come from,

385
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:32,223
Jackie doesn't know how to work
the timer on the video recorder.

386
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,629
I showed her that last week.

387
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:35,545
Point taken.

388
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:44,622
Rose, you're not going to bring about
the end of the world, are you?

389
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:46,619
Are you?

390
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:54,180
Jackie gave her to me to look after.

391
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,309
How times change.

392
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,264
I'd better be careful.

393
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,547
I think I just imprinted myself on Mickey
like a mother chicken.

394
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:05,660
No. Don't touch the baby.

395
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,905
You're both the same person,
that's a paradox.

396
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:14,027
We don't want a paradox happening,
not with these things outside.

397
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:17,785
Anything new, any disturbance in time,
makes them stronger.

398
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,902
A paradox might let them in.

399
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,668
I can't do anything right, can I?

400
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:27,540
Since you asked, no.
So, don't touch the baby.

401
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:30,742
-I'm not stupid.
-You could have fooled me.

402
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:36,984
All right...

403
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,264
I'm sorry.

404
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:43,101
I wasn't really gonna leave you
on your own.

405
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:44,225
I know.

406
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:47,859
Between you and me,
I haven't got a plan. No idea.

407
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:51,461
No way out.

408
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:53,825
You'll think of something.

409
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:55,707
The entire Earth's been sterilised.

410
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:59,499
This, and other places like it,
are all that's left of the human race.

411
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:02,821
We might hold out for a while,
but nothing can stop those creatures.

412
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:06,220
They'll get through in the end.
The walls aren't that old.

413
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,741
And there's nothing I can do
to stop them.

414
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:11,788
There used to be laws stopping
this kind of thing from happening.

415
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:13,622
My people would have stopped this.

416
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:16,748
But they're all gone.

417
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:20,100
And now I'm going the same way.

418
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,669
If I'd realised....

419
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,343
Just...

420
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:29,668
tell me you're sorry.

421
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:32,585
I am.

422
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,504
I'm sorry.

423
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,945
Have you got something hot?

424
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:54,269
It's the Tardis key.

425
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:05,103
It's telling me
it's still connected to the Tardis.

426
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:07,750
The inside of my ship
was thrown out of the wound

427
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,582
but we can use this to bring it back.

428
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:12,343
And once I've got my ship back,
then I can mend everything.

429
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:15,183
Now, I just need a bit of power.
Has anybody got a battery?

430
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,584
This one big enough?

431
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,139
Fantastic.

432
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:22,186
Good old Dad. There you go.

433
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:26,223
Just need to do a bit of charging up.

434
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:28,187
And then we can bring everyone back.

you came here in the first place.

438
00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:00,941
If I had a time machine, I wouldn't have
thought 1 987 was anything special.

439
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,258
Not round here, anyway.

440
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:05,740
-We just ended up here.
-Lucky for me, eh?

441
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:09,027
-If you hadn't been there to save me....
-That was just a coincidence.

442
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:12,819
That was just really good luck.
It's amazing.

00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:20,424
So, in the future,
are me and her indoors still together?

00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:22,619
Yeah.

-Yep.

You....

448
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:44,746
You told me a bedtime story
every night when I was small.

449
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:47,742
You were always there,
you never missed one.

And, erm...

451
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:59,226
you took us for picnics
in the country every Saturday.

452
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,503
You never let us down.

453
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:06,585
You were there for us all the time.

it'll be, well, zap!

will be fine. We'll get out. All of us.

He didn't want you to go through it
again. Not if there was another way.

511
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:15,542
For once in your life, trust me.
It's got to be done.

512
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:19,545
You've got to survive 'cause you've got to
bring up our daughter.

513
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:37,429
I never read you those bedtime stories,
I never took you on those picnics.

514
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,987
I was never there for you.

515
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,989
You would've been.

516
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:44,102
But I can do this for you.

517
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:47,106
I can be a proper dad to you now.

518
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:49,144
But it's not fair.

519
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:51,266
I've had all these extra hours.

520
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:54,145
No one else in the world
has ever had that.

521
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:57,427
And on top of that, I get to see you.

522
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:02,581
And you're beautiful.

523
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:07,028
How lucky am I, eh?

524
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:10,908
So, come on.
Do as your dad says.

525
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:21,382
You gonna be there for me, love?

526
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,906
Thanks for saving me.

Goodbye, love.

Go to him. Quick.

(MUM) <i>The driver was just a kid.</i>

531

He stopped, he waited for the police.

532
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:19,262
It wasn't his fault.

533
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:22,500
For some reason, Pete just ran out.

534
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:27,181
People say there was this girl.

535
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:30,698
And she sat with Pete
while he was dying.

536
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:32,348
She held his hand.

537
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:36,023
Then she was gone.

538
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:39,786
Never found out who she was.

It's mauve and dangerous, and about
30 seconds from the centre of London.

-I have my moments.

They've all got the same injuries.

Right down to the scar
on the back of the hand.

550
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:54,259
Physical injuries as plague.
