The turn of the Earth. The ground beneath
our feet spinning at 1,000 miles an hour,

168
00:16:09,617 --> 00:16:15,249
and the entire planet is hurtling round the sun
at 67,000 miles an hour, and I can feel it.

169
00:16:15,417 --> 00:16:18,409
We're falling through space, you and me,

170
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:22,855
clinging to the skin of this tiny little world,
and if we let go...

171
00:16:25,297 --> 00:16:26,889
That's who I am.

172

- Coffee?
- Yeah, only if you wash the mug.

- Not rinse, wash. Can I use your computer?
- Yeah. Any excuse to get in the bedroom!

Don't read my emails!

You're not coming in. He's safe.
He's got a wife and kids.

what an internet murderer would say!

We've been emailing.

Oh, sorry. Hello.
You must be Rose. I'm Clive, obviously.

My boyfriend's waiting in the car -
just in case you're gonna kill me (!)

188

Good point. No murders!

189
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:27,489
- (WOMAN) Who is it?
- It's to do with the Doctor.

190
00:19:27,657 --> 00:19:31,650
She's been reading the website.
Come through. I'm in the shed.

191
00:19:31,817 --> 00:19:33,728
(WIFE) She?

192
00:19:33,897 --> 00:19:38,254
She's read the website about the Doctor
and she's a she?

193
00:19:41,537 --> 00:19:47,487
A lot of this stuff's quite sensitive. I couldn't
just send it to you. People might intercept it.

194
00:19:48,257 --> 00:19:53,650
If you dig deep enough and keep a lively mind,
this Doctor crops up all over the place -

00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:57,969
political diaries, conspiracy theories,
even ghost stories.

196
00:19:58,137 --> 00:20:00,856
No first name, no last name,

197
00:20:01,017 --> 00:20:04,327
just ''the Doctor'' - always ''the Doctor''.

198
00:20:04,497 --> 00:20:09,173
And the title seems to be passed down
from father to son - an inheritance.

199
00:20:09,337 --> 00:20:11,009
That's your Doctor there.

200
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:12,496
(ROSE) Yeah.

201
00:20:12,657 --> 00:20:17,856

208
00:20:50,897 --> 00:20:55,049
This was taken the day
before they were due to sail on the Titanic.

209
00:20:55,217 --> 00:21:00,689

the trip and survived. Here we are...

Look - the same lineage. It's identical.

212
00:21:07,777 --> 00:21:12,567
This one washed up on the coast of Sumatra
the night that Krakatoa exploded.

213
00:21:12,737 --> 00:21:17,811
The Doctor is a legend woven throughout history.
When disaster comes, he's there.

214
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:21,936
He brings a storm in his wake,
and has one constant companion.

Who's that?

216

I think he's the same man.

I think he's immortal.

230

- Or a Chinese.

'cause of him and look where he ended up.

- Where did you meet this Doctor?
- Sorry. Did I talk about me then (?)

241
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:30,966
It started at the shop, right?
Was he something to do with that?

- No.
- Come on.

- I'm not going on about it, Mickey. I'm not.

The assembled hordes of Genghis Khan couldn't
get through that door. Believe me, they've tried.

00:27:24,457 --> 00:27:29,247
(DOCTOR) You see, the arm was too simple,
but the head is perfect.

272
00:27:29,417 --> 00:27:33,933
I can use it to trace the signal
back to the original source.

273
00:27:34,097 --> 00:27:36,895
Right. Where do you want to start?

274
00:27:37,817 --> 00:27:40,251
The inside is bigger than the outside.

275
00:27:40,417 --> 00:27:42,294
- Yes.
- It's alien.

276
00:27:42,457 --> 00:27:44,448
Yep.

00:27:44,617 --> 00:27:46,255
Are you alien?

Yes.

- Happens to the best of us.
- Did they kill him? Mickey?

283
00:28:03,857 --> 00:28:06,087
Did they kill Mickey? Is he dead?

284
00:28:06,657 --> 00:28:08,727
Oh. I didn't think of that.

285
00:28:08,897 --> 00:28:14,051
He's my boyfriend. You pulled off his head.
They copied him and you didn't even think?

286
00:28:14,217 --> 00:28:16,936
- And now you're just gonna let him melt?
- Melt?

287
00:28:19,377 --> 00:28:23,450
- (DOCTOR YELLS) No, no, no!
- What are you doing?

288
00:28:23,617 --> 00:28:26,051
Following the signal. It's fading.

00:28:40,897 --> 00:28:43,570
You can't go out there. It's not safe.

I lost the signal. I got so close!

00:28:51,537 --> 00:28:56,611
- We've moved. Does it fly?
- Disappears there and reappears here.

295
00:28:56,777 --> 00:29:00,372
What about that headless thing?
It's still on the loose.

296
00:29:00,537 --> 00:29:05,930
- It melted with the head. Stop wittering on.
- I'll have to tell his mother.

297
00:29:08,657 --> 00:29:13,014
Mickey. I'll have to tell his mother he's dead.
You forgot him again!

298
00:29:14,017 --> 00:29:18,010
- You were right. You ARE alien.
- If I did forget some kid,

299
00:29:18,177 --> 00:29:22,807
it's because I'm trying to save
every stupid ape on this planet, all right?

300
00:29:22,977 --> 00:29:24,569
- All right.
- Yes, it is!

301
00:29:26,737 --> 00:29:32,016
- Why do you sound like you're from the north?
- Lots of planets have a north.

302
00:29:33,697 --> 00:29:36,450
What's a police public call box?

303
00:29:37,617 --> 00:29:39,733
It's a telephone box from the 1950s.

304
00:29:40,937 --> 00:29:43,690
- It's a disguise.
- OK.

305
00:29:43,857 --> 00:29:48,248
- This living plastic, what's it got against us?
- Nothing. It loves you.

306
00:29:48,417 --> 00:29:53,491
You have a great planet. Lots of smoke and oil,
toxins and dioxins in the air. Perfect.

307
00:29:53,657 --> 00:29:58,253
Just what the Nestene Consciousness needs.
Its food stock was destroyed.

308
00:29:58,417 --> 00:30:02,410
- Its protein planets rotted, so Earth - dinner!
- Can you stop it?

309
00:30:03,377 --> 00:30:06,096
- Antiplastic.
- Antiplastic?

310
00:30:07,257 --> 00:30:11,216
First I've got to find it.
How can you hide something that big?

311
00:30:11,377 --> 00:30:13,015
- What?
- The transmitter.

312
00:30:13,177 --> 00:30:18,046
The Consciousness controls the plastic.
The transmitter boosts the signal.

313
00:30:18,217 --> 00:30:22,369
- What does it look like?
- Like a transmitter. Round and massive.

314
00:30:22,537 --> 00:30:27,657
Slap bang in the middle of London.
A huge metal circular structure. Like a wheel.

315
00:30:27,817 --> 00:30:31,605
Close to where we're standing.
Must be completely invisible.

316
00:30:31,777 --> 00:30:33,176
What?

317
00:30:35,217 --> 00:30:36,889
What?

318
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:40,689
What is it? What?

319
00:30:44,297 --> 00:30:46,333
Oh.

320
00:30:47,257 --> 00:30:49,566
Fantastic!

321
00:31:09,577 --> 00:31:13,616
Think of it - plastic all over the world.
Everything coming alive.

322
00:31:13,777 --> 00:31:16,245
The shop window dummies, phones, wires.

323
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:18,806
- The cables...
- The breast implants.

324
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:22,492
The Consciousness must be
somewhere underneath.

325
00:31:25,297 --> 00:31:27,367
What about down here?

326
00:31:30,697 --> 00:31:32,050
Looks good to me.

327
00:32:14,217 --> 00:32:20,167
The Nestene Consciousness.
That's it inside the vat. A living plastic creature.

328
00:32:20,337 --> 00:32:24,330
- Tip in your antiplastic and let's go.
- I'm not here to kill it.

329
00:32:24,497 --> 00:32:26,806
I've got to give it a chance.

330
