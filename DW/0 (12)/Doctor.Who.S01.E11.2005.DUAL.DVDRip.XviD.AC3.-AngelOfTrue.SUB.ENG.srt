1
00:00:05,767 --> 00:00:08,565
There's still no word from inside Downing Street.

2
00:00:12,407 --> 00:00:14,921
Though we are getting even more new arrivals.

3
00:00:18,647 --> 00:00:20,444
We are the Slitheen.

4
00:00:20,727 --> 00:00:23,764
Reduce the Earth to molten slag then sell it.

5
00:00:23,847 --> 00:00:25,838
Leave this planet or I'll stop you.

6
00:00:29,127 --> 00:00:30,526
The world is in your hands.

7
00:00:47,687 --> 00:00:50,918
I've checked the figures.
I've checked them again and again.

8
00:00:51,007 --> 00:00:52,918
Always the same result.

9
00:00:53,767 --> 00:00:57,760
The design is not safe.
It could result in the death of millions.

10
00:00:58,727 --> 00:01:03,437
I beg of you, stop the project right now
before it's too late.

11
00:01:04,127 --> 00:01:06,277
(MARGARET) Well, goodness me!

12
00:01:08,447 --> 00:01:11,245
Obviously, Mr Cleaver, you're the expert.

13
00:01:11,687 --> 00:01:13,439
Then, you'll stop it?

14
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:16,677
It seems I have no choice.

15
00:01:17,967 --> 00:01:19,605
(RUMBLING)

16
00:01:20,007 --> 00:01:22,646
Oh, do excuse me.

17
00:01:23,207 --> 00:01:27,598
-Civic duties leave little time for a sandwich.
-But you promise you'll stop it today?

18
00:01:28,207 --> 00:01:29,799
Well, of course!

19
00:01:29,967 --> 00:01:32,606
Nothing is more important than human life.

20
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:37,519
What do you take me for?
Some sort of maniac?

21
00:01:38,287 --> 00:01:39,356
Why, no.

22
00:01:39,447 --> 00:01:43,235
Am I right in thinking
you've shown your results only to me?

23
00:01:43,647 --> 00:01:46,719
-Just to you, no one else.
-Wise move.

24
00:01:46,967 --> 00:01:49,879
I can't tell you, Mrs Blaine,
this is such a weight off my mind.

25
00:01:49,967 --> 00:01:53,164
I've barely slept.
I couldn't believe my own readings.

26
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:57,798
The scale of it. Destruction like
the British Isles has never seen before.

27
00:01:59,407 --> 00:02:03,195
If I didn't know better, I'd almost think that
someone wanted this project to go wrong.

28
00:02:03,287 --> 00:02:07,121
As though they intended this city
should be wiped off the map.

29
00:02:10,607 --> 00:02:13,963
Thank goodness we've got you,
our esteemed leader.

Whatever you're selling, we're not buying.

Get out of my way!

36

Don't tell me, this must be Mickey.

37
00:03:40,647 --> 00:03:42,524
Here comes trouble. How you doing, Ricky boy?

38
00:03:42,607 --> 00:03:45,075
-It's Mickey.
-Don't listen to him, he's winding you up.

39
00:03:45,167 --> 00:03:46,885
You look fantastic.

40
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:50,563
Aw, sweet. Look at these two.
How come I never get any of that?

41
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,683
-Buy me a drink first.
-You're such hard work.

42
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:53,916
But worth it.

43
00:03:54,007 --> 00:03:56,043
Did you manage to find it?

44
00:03:56,127 --> 00:03:57,845
-There you go.
-I can go anywhere now.

45
00:03:57,927 --> 00:03:59,565
I've told you, you don't need a passport.

46
00:03:59,647 --> 00:04:02,480
It's all very well
going to Platform One and Justicia

47
00:04:02,567 --> 00:04:05,843
and the Glass Pyramid of San Kaloon,
but what if we end up in Brazil?

48
00:04:05,927 --> 00:04:08,919
I might need it.
You see, I'm prepared for anything.

49
00:04:09,007 --> 00:04:10,918
Sounds like you're staying, then.

50
00:04:16,087 --> 00:04:19,159
So, what are you doing in Cardiff?
And who the hell's Jumping Jack Flash?

51
00:04:19,247 --> 00:04:21,158
I don't mind you hanging out
with Big Ears up there.

52
00:04:21,247 --> 00:04:22,839
-Oi!
-Look in the mirror.

53
00:04:23,487 --> 00:04:26,126
-But this guy, I don't know, he's kind of....
-Handsome?

54
00:04:26,207 --> 00:04:27,356
More like cheesy.

55
00:04:27,447 --> 00:04:30,598
Early 21st century slang. Is cheesy good or bad?

56
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,201
-It's bad.
-But bad means good, isn't that right?

57
00:04:33,287 --> 00:04:34,436
You saying I'm not handsome?

58
00:04:34,527 --> 00:04:36,677
We've just stopped off, we need to refuel.

59
00:04:36,767 --> 00:04:40,077
The thing is, Cardiff's got this rift
running through the middle of the city.

60
00:04:40,167 --> 00:04:43,523
It's invisible, but it's like an earthquake
fault between different dimensions.

61
00:04:43,607 --> 00:04:45,040
The rift was healed back in 1 869....

62
00:04:45,127 --> 00:04:47,800
Thanks to a girl named Gwyneth
because these creatures called the Gelth

63
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:50,924
were using the rift as a gateway,
but she saved the world and closed it.

64
00:04:51,007 --> 00:04:53,760
But closing a rift always leaves a scar
and that scar generates energy,

65
00:04:53,847 --> 00:04:54,996
harmless to the human race....

66
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:56,122
But perfect for the Tardis.

67
00:04:56,207 --> 00:04:58,960
Just park here for a couple of days,
right on top of the scar and....

68
00:04:59,047 --> 00:05:01,038
Open up the engines, soak up the radiation....

69
00:05:01,127 --> 00:05:03,118
Like filling her up with petrol and off we go.

70
00:05:03,207 --> 00:05:05,198
-Into time.
-And space.

71
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:09,039
My God, have you seen yourselves?
You all think you're so clever, don't you?

72
00:05:09,127 --> 00:05:10,162
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

73
00:05:10,247 --> 00:05:11,236
Yeah.

74
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:15,079
Should take another 24 hours
which means we've got time to kill.

75
00:05:15,167 --> 00:05:16,839
That old lady's staring.

76
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:20,442
Probably wondering what four people
can do inside a small wooden box.

77
00:05:20,527 --> 00:05:22,995
What are you captain of? The Innuendo Squad?

78
00:05:24,727 --> 00:05:28,003
Wait, the Tardis, you can't just leave it.
Doesn't it get noticed?

79
00:05:28,087 --> 00:05:30,203
Yeah, what's with the police box?
Why does it look like that?

80
00:05:30,287 --> 00:05:32,721
-It's a cloaking device.
-It's called a chameleon circuit.

81
00:05:32,807 --> 00:05:34,877
The Tardis is meant to disguise itself
wherever it lands.

82
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,925
Like, if this was ancient Rome,
it'd be a statue on a plinth or something.

83
00:05:38,007 --> 00:05:40,726
But I landed in the 1 960s,
it disguised itself as a police box

84
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:42,286
and the circuit got stuck.

85
00:05:42,367 --> 00:05:44,676
So, it copied a real thing?
There actually was police boxes?

86
00:05:44,767 --> 00:05:45,836
Yeah, on street corners.

87
00:05:45,927 --> 00:05:47,963
You could phone for help
before they had radios and mobiles.

88
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:50,880
If they arrested somebody, they could
shove them inside till help came.

89
00:05:50,967 --> 00:05:53,800
-Like a little prison cell.
-Why don't you just fix the circuit?

90
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:55,525
-I like it, don't you?
-I love it.

91
00:05:55,607 --> 00:05:57,962
But that's what I meant,
there's no police boxes anymore

92
00:05:58,047 --> 00:05:59,685
so doesn't it get noticed?

93
00:05:59,767 --> 00:06:02,520
Ricky, let me tell you something about
the human race.

94
00:06:02,607 --> 00:06:06,759
You put a mysterious blue box slap-bang
in the middle of town, what do they do?

95
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,236
Walk past it. Now, stop your nagging,
let's go and explore.

96
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,680
(ROSE) What's the plan?
(DOCTOR) I don't know.

97
00:06:10,767 --> 00:06:14,396
(DOCTOR) Cardiff, early 21st century,
and the wind's coming from the...east.

98
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,836
Trust me. Safest place in the universe.

99
00:06:16,927 --> 00:06:20,397
This nuclear power station
right in the heart of Cardiff city

100
00:06:20,487 --> 00:06:22,443
will bring jobs for all.

101
00:06:25,687 --> 00:06:27,279
As you can see, as Lord Mayor,

102
00:06:27,367 --> 00:06:30,404
I've had to sanction some radical redevelopments.

103
00:06:31,047 --> 00:06:33,322
No photographs! What did I say?

104
00:06:33,447 --> 00:06:37,235
Take pictures of the project, by all means,
but not me, thank you.

105
00:06:37,767 --> 00:06:41,442
So, Cardiff Castle will be demolished,

106
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:45,520
allowing the Blaidd Drwg project to rise up,
tall and proud.

107
00:06:46,207 --> 00:06:48,482
A monument to Welsh industry.

108
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:51,127
And, yes, some of you might shiver.

109
00:06:51,207 --> 00:06:54,404
The words ''nuclear power station''
and ''major population centre''

110
00:06:54,487 --> 00:06:57,399
aren't exactly the happiest of bedfellows.

111
00:06:57,487 --> 00:07:02,561
But I give you my personal guarantee
that as long as I walk upon this Earth,

112
00:07:02,647 --> 00:07:05,400
no harm will come to any of my citizens.

113
00:07:06,487 --> 00:07:07,636
Now, drink up!

114
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:10,195
A toast, to the future.

115
00:07:10,567 --> 00:07:11,920
(ALL) To the future.

116
00:07:12,007 --> 00:07:14,441
And believe me...

117
00:07:14,527 --> 00:07:16,279
it will glow.

118
00:07:21,047 --> 00:07:24,244
Mrs Blaine, my name's Cathy Salt.
I represent the <i>Cardiff Gazette.</i>

119
00:07:24,327 --> 00:07:26,887
I'm sorry, I'm not doing interviews.
I can't bear self-publicity.

120
00:07:26,967 --> 00:07:30,437
-But are you aware of the curse?
-Whatever do you mean?

121
00:07:31,087 --> 00:07:32,759
-Cathy, wasn't it?
-Cathy Salt.

122
00:07:32,847 --> 00:07:34,724
That's what some of your engineers are saying,

123
00:07:34,807 --> 00:07:36,525
that the Blaidd Drwg project is cursed.

124
00:07:36,607 --> 00:07:37,835
Sounds rather silly to me.

125
00:07:37,927 --> 00:07:40,487
That's what I thought,
I was just chasing a bit of local colour.

126
00:07:40,567 --> 00:07:42,956
But the funny thing is,
when you start piecing it all together,

127
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:44,275
it does begin to look a bit odd.

128
00:07:44,367 --> 00:07:46,085
-In what way?
-The deaths.

129
00:07:46,247 --> 00:07:48,203
The number of deaths associated
with this project.

130
00:07:48,287 --> 00:07:51,563
First of all, there was the entire team
of the European Safety Inspectors.

131
00:07:51,647 --> 00:07:53,046
But they were French.

132
00:07:53,127 --> 00:07:55,846
It's not my fault if ''Danger Explosives''
was only written in Welsh.

133
00:07:55,927 --> 00:07:58,395
And there was that accident
with the Cardiff Heritage Committee.

134
00:07:58,487 --> 00:08:02,036
The electrocution of that swimming pool
was put down to natural wear and tear.

135
00:08:02,127 --> 00:08:04,197
And then the architect?

136
00:08:04,407 --> 00:08:07,717
It was raining, visibility was low,
my car simply couldn't stop.

137
00:08:07,807 --> 00:08:10,958
And then just recently, Mr Cleaver,
the government's nuclear adviser.

138
00:08:11,047 --> 00:08:12,526
Slipped on an icy patch.

139
00:08:12,607 --> 00:08:15,485
-He was decapitated.
-It was a very icy patch.

140
00:08:15,567 --> 00:08:18,843
I'm afraid these stories are nothing more
than typical small-town thinking.

141
00:08:18,927 --> 00:08:20,918
I really haven't got time. If you'll excuse me.

142
00:08:21,007 --> 00:08:25,080
Except before he died, Mr Cleaver
posted some of his findings online.

143
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:26,964
-Did he now?
-If you know where to look.

144
00:08:27,047 --> 00:08:29,641
-He was concerned about the reactor.
-All that technical stuff.

145
00:08:29,727 --> 00:08:32,116
Specifically, that the design
of the suppression pool

146
00:08:32,207 --> 00:08:34,038
would cause the hydrogen recombiners to fail,

147
00:08:34,127 --> 00:08:36,880
precipitating in the collapse
of the containment isolation system

148
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:38,161
and resulting in a meltdown.

149
00:08:38,247 --> 00:08:41,205
-Who's been doing her homework?
-That's my job.

150
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:44,324
I think...Cathy Salt...

151
00:08:45,447 --> 00:08:48,280
I think you and I should have a word in private.

152
00:08:50,567 --> 00:08:51,602
(RUMBLING)

153
00:08:51,687 --> 00:08:53,917
Oh! My little tummy is complaining.

154
00:08:54,007 --> 00:08:56,316
I think we might have to
make a detour to the ladies'.

155
00:08:56,407 --> 00:08:59,763
-I'll wait here.
-Come on. All girls together.

156
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:04,836
So, you were saying?
These outlandish theories of yours.

157
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:08,885
(SQUELCHING)

158
00:09:08,967 --> 00:09:12,357
-Sounds like we got here just in time.
-Continue.

159
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:15,803
Well, I don't know much about nuclear physics,

160
00:09:15,927 --> 00:09:17,565
but from what I could make out,

161
00:09:17,647 --> 00:09:22,084
Cleaver was saying that the whole project
could go up, worse than Chernobyl.

162
00:09:25,127 --> 00:09:27,118
Is there something wrong with the lights?

163
00:09:27,207 --> 00:09:28,925
They're always on the blink.

164
00:09:29,007 --> 00:09:31,726
I can't tell you how many memos I've sent.

165
00:09:31,807 --> 00:09:33,877
So, Chernobyl?

166
00:09:33,967 --> 00:09:36,925
Apparently, but a thousand times worse.

167
00:09:37,007 --> 00:09:40,556
I mean, it sounds absurd,
there must be so many safety regulations.

168
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:44,196
But Cleaver seemed to be talking about
a nuclear holocaust.

169
00:09:44,287 --> 00:09:46,960
He almost made it sound deliberate.

170
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,043
I mean, we're hardly the <i>Sunday Times,</i>

171
00:09:49,127 --> 00:09:52,881
we're only the <i>Cardiff Gazette,</i>
but we still have a duty to report the facts.

172
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:55,640
And you're going to print this information?

173
00:09:55,727 --> 00:09:57,365
Are you all right? You sound a bit....

174
00:09:57,447 --> 00:09:58,846
Sore throat.

175
00:09:58,927 --> 00:10:00,645
(MARGARET COUGHING)

176
00:10:00,727 --> 00:10:02,558
Just a little tickle.

177
00:10:02,687 --> 00:10:06,282
But tell me, do you intend to make
this information public?

178
00:10:06,367 --> 00:10:07,686
I have to.

179
00:10:09,247 --> 00:10:10,965
So be it.

180
00:10:11,847 --> 00:10:14,520
Mind you, my boyfriend thinks I'm mad.

181
00:10:15,447 --> 00:10:17,199
We're getting married next month

182
00:10:17,287 --> 00:10:19,801
and he says if I cause a fuss, I could lose my job,

183
00:10:19,887 --> 00:10:21,798
just when we need the money.

184
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:23,400
-Boyfriend?
-Jeffrey.

185
00:10:24,007 --> 00:10:27,317
Civil servant.
He's nothing exciting, but he's mine.

186
00:10:27,487 --> 00:10:30,001
-When's the wedding?
-The 1 9th.

187
00:10:30,207 --> 00:10:32,277
It's really just to stop my mother from nagging,

188
00:10:32,367 --> 00:10:35,359
but the baby sort of clinched it, I suppose.

189
00:10:37,527 --> 00:10:39,438
You're with child?

190
00:10:41,287 --> 00:10:44,165
Three months, it's not showing yet.

191
00:10:45,567 --> 00:10:49,242
Wasn't planned, it was an accident.
Nice accident, though.

192
00:10:49,767 --> 00:10:51,917
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

193
00:10:52,727 --> 00:10:55,525
-How about you?
-No.

194
00:10:56,247 --> 00:10:59,000
-Is there a Mr Blaine?
-Not anymore.

195
00:10:59,687 --> 00:11:01,359
I'm all on my own.

196
00:11:02,447 --> 00:11:04,915
I had quite a sizeable family once upon a time.

197
00:11:05,007 --> 00:11:07,965
Wonderful brothers. Oh, they were bold.

198
00:11:09,167 --> 00:11:11,203
But all of them gone, now.

199
00:11:12,527 --> 00:11:15,883
Maybe you're right. Maybe I'm cursed.

200
00:11:16,007 --> 00:11:18,396
No, I don't think so, not really.

201
00:11:18,527 --> 00:11:20,165
You're very kind.

202
00:11:22,247 --> 00:11:24,886
If you don't mind, I might be a while.

203
00:11:25,087 --> 00:11:28,397
You run along.
Perhaps we could do this another day.

204
00:11:28,807 --> 00:11:31,082
-Are you all right?
-Fine.

205
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:35,001
Okay, I tell you what,
I'll leave my details with your office.

206
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:37,285
Thanks for talking.

207
00:11:38,207 --> 00:11:39,526
Thank you.

208
00:11:49,727 --> 00:11:51,763
(LOW MOANING)

209
00:11:57,087 --> 00:11:59,920
(JACK) I swear!
(DOCTOR) You're lying through your teeth!

210
00:12:00,007 --> 00:12:03,522
It turns out the white things
are tusks, and I mean, tusks!

211
00:12:03,607 --> 00:12:05,040
And it's woken and it's not happy.

212
00:12:05,127 --> 00:12:08,517
-How could you not know it was there?
-We're standing there, 1 5 of us, naked.

213
00:12:08,607 --> 00:12:10,996
And I'm like,
''No, it's got nothing to do with me.''

214
00:12:11,087 --> 00:12:13,885
And then it roars, and we're running.
My God, we are running.

215
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:16,242
And Brakovitch falls so I turn to him and I say....

216
00:12:16,327 --> 00:12:19,046
-I knew we should have turned left!
-That's my line!

217
00:12:20,047 --> 00:12:23,722
I don't believe you, I don't believe
a word you say, ever. That is so brilliant!

218
00:12:23,807 --> 00:12:25,320
Did you ever get your clothes back?

219
00:12:25,407 --> 00:12:27,557
No, I just picked him up
and went right for the ship.

220
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:31,037
Full throttle, didn't stop till I hit
the space lanes. I was shaking!

221
00:12:31,207 --> 00:12:34,244
It was unbelievable! Freaked me out.
And by the time I got there,

222
00:12:34,327 --> 00:12:37,603
I was 1 5 light years away
and I realised I'm like this....

223
00:12:37,687 --> 00:12:40,121
And I was having such a nice day.

224
00:12:52,247 --> 00:12:53,680
According to Intelligence,

225
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:56,281
the target is the last surviving member
of the Slitheen family.

226
00:12:56,367 --> 00:12:59,006
A criminal sect from the planet
Rexicoricophalvitorius

227
00:12:59,087 --> 00:13:01,726
masquerading as a human being,
zipped inside a skin suit.

228
00:13:01,807 --> 00:13:04,719
Okay, plan of attack.
We assume a basic 57-56 strategy,

229
00:13:04,807 --> 00:13:07,162
covering all available exits on the ground floor.

230
00:13:07,247 --> 00:13:09,920
Doctor, you go face to face,
that'll designate Exit 1 .

231
00:13:10,007 --> 00:13:12,601
I'll cover Exit 2. Rose, you Exit 3,

232
00:13:12,687 --> 00:13:15,201
Mickey Smith, you take Exit 4. Have you got that?

233
00:13:15,287 --> 00:13:17,437
Excuse me, who's in charge?

234
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:20,926
Sorry, awaiting orders, sir.

235
00:13:21,407 --> 00:13:23,318
Right, here's the plan.

236
00:13:25,047 --> 00:13:27,197
Like he said. Nice plan. Anything else?

237
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,206
-Present arms.
-Ready.

238
00:13:29,287 --> 00:13:30,515
-Ready.
-Ready.

239
00:13:30,927 --> 00:13:31,962
-Speed dial?
-Yeah.

240
00:13:32,047 --> 00:13:33,036
-Ready.
-Check.

241
00:13:33,127 --> 00:13:34,879
See you in hell.

242
00:13:42,927 --> 00:13:44,838
Hello, I've come to see the Lord Mayor.

243
00:13:44,927 --> 00:13:46,406
Have you got an appointment?

244
00:13:46,487 --> 00:13:49,001
No, just an old friend passing by,
bit of a surprise.

245
00:13:49,087 --> 00:13:50,520
Can't wait to see her face.

246
00:13:50,607 --> 00:13:52,837
Well, she's just having a cup of tea.

247
00:13:52,927 --> 00:13:56,044
Just go in there and tell her
the Doctor would like to see her.

248
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:57,276
Doctor who?

249
00:13:57,367 --> 00:14:00,837
Just the Doctor. Tell her exactly that, the Doctor.

250
00:14:02,087 --> 00:14:03,600
Hang on a tick.

251
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:12,566
(CUP SHATTERING)

252
00:14:18,767 --> 00:14:22,043
The Lord Mayor says thank you for popping by.

253
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:24,516
She'd love to have a chat

254
00:14:24,607 --> 00:14:26,518
but she's up to her eyes in paperwork.

255
00:14:26,607 --> 00:14:29,121
Perhaps if you could make an appointment
for next week?

256
00:14:29,207 --> 00:14:31,323
She's climbing out of the window, isn't she?

257
00:14:31,407 --> 00:14:32,760
Yes, she is.

258
00:14:41,567 --> 00:14:43,523
-Slitheen heading north.
-On my way.

259
00:14:43,607 --> 00:14:45,006
Over and out.

260
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:47,361
Oh, my God!

261
00:14:48,007 --> 00:14:49,486
Leave the Mayor alone!

262
00:14:56,087 --> 00:14:57,361
(WOMAN SCREAMING)

263
00:15:21,967 --> 00:15:23,639
Margaret!

264
00:15:30,007 --> 00:15:32,567
-Who's on Exit 4?
-That was Mickey!

265
00:15:32,727 --> 00:15:34,445
-Here I am.
-Mickey the idiot.

266
00:15:34,527 --> 00:15:37,803
Be fair, she's not exactly gonna outrun us, is she?

267
00:15:40,447 --> 00:15:43,439
She's got a teleport! That's cheating.
Now, we're never gonna get her!

268
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:46,041
The Doctor's very good at teleports.

269
00:16:03,807 --> 00:16:05,559
I could do this all day.

270
00:16:05,647 --> 00:16:08,002
This is persecution.
Why can't you leave me alone?

271
00:16:08,087 --> 00:16:09,361
What did I ever do to you?

272
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:12,286
You tried to kill me and destroy this entire planet.

273
00:16:12,367 --> 00:16:13,516
Apart from that.

274
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:16,646
So, you're a Slitheen, you're on Earth,
you're trapped.

275
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:20,436
Your family get killed, but you teleport out,
just in the nick of time.

276
00:16:20,567 --> 00:16:22,637
You have no means of escape, what do you do?

277
00:16:22,727 --> 00:16:25,560
You build a nuclear power station. But what for?

278
00:16:26,127 --> 00:16:29,199
A philanthropic gesture.
I've learnt the error of my ways.

279
00:16:29,287 --> 00:16:31,755
And it just so happens to be
right on top of the rift.

280
00:16:31,847 --> 00:16:34,441
-What rift would that be?
-A rift in space and time.

281
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:37,917
If this power station went into meltdown,
the entire planet would go....

282
00:16:38,007 --> 00:16:41,556
This station is designed to explode
the minute it reaches capacity.

283
00:16:41,647 --> 00:16:43,080
Didn't anyone notice?

284
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:45,522
Isn't there someone in London
checking this sort of stuff?

285
00:16:45,607 --> 00:16:48,280
We're in Cardiff. London doesn't care.

286
00:16:48,367 --> 00:16:51,518
The South Wales coast could fall
into the sea and they wouldn't notice.

287
00:16:51,847 --> 00:16:56,637
Oh! I sound like a Welshman.
God help me, I've gone native.

288
00:16:56,727 --> 00:16:58,080
But why would she do that?

289
00:16:58,167 --> 00:17:00,283
A great big explosion,
she'd only end up killing herself.

290
00:17:00,367 --> 00:17:03,757
-She's got a name, you know.
-She's not even a she, she's a thing.

291
00:17:03,847 --> 00:17:05,485
Oh, but she's clever.

292
00:17:11,807 --> 00:17:12,956
Fantastic!

293
00:17:13,047 --> 00:17:16,119
Is that a tribophysical waveform
macro-kinetic extrapolator?

294
00:17:16,207 --> 00:17:18,118
Couldn't have put it better myself.

295
00:17:18,207 --> 00:17:21,005
Genius! You didn't build this?

296
00:17:21,087 --> 00:17:22,884
I have my hobbies, a little tinkering.

297
00:17:22,967 --> 00:17:26,357
No, I mean, you really didn't build this.
Way beyond you.

298
00:17:26,447 --> 00:17:29,007
-I bet she stole it.
-It fell into my hands.

299
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,396
-Is it a weapon?
-It's transport.

300
00:17:32,247 --> 00:17:36,957
You see, if the reactor blows, the rift opens.
Phenomenal cosmic disaster.

301
00:17:37,287 --> 00:17:39,847
But this thing shrouds you in a force-field.

302
00:17:39,927 --> 00:17:42,839
You have this energy bubble....
So you're safe.

303
00:17:42,927 --> 00:17:45,202
Then you feed it coordinates, stand on top

304
00:17:45,287 --> 00:17:48,165
and ride the concussion
all the way out of the solar system.

305
00:17:48,247 --> 00:17:51,000
-It's a surfboard.
-A pan-dimensional surfboard, yeah.

306
00:17:51,087 --> 00:17:52,236
And it would've worked.

307
00:17:52,327 --> 00:17:55,842
I'd have surfed away from this
dead-end dump and back to civilisation.

308
00:17:55,927 --> 00:17:57,804
You'd blow up a whole planet just to get a lift?

309
00:17:57,887 --> 00:18:00,037
Like stepping on an ant hill.

310
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:02,199
How did you think of the name?

311
00:18:02,287 --> 00:18:05,279
What? Blaidd Drwg? It's Welsh.

312
00:18:05,367 --> 00:18:07,437
I know, but how did you think of it?

313
00:18:07,527 --> 00:18:11,805
I chose it at random, that's all,
I don't know. Just sounded good.

314
00:18:12,047 --> 00:18:13,560
Does it matter?

315
00:18:16,727 --> 00:18:18,126
Blaidd Drwg.

316
00:18:18,447 --> 00:18:20,597
-What's it mean?
-''Bad Wolf.''

317
00:18:21,247 --> 00:18:25,957
But I've heard that before. Bad Wolf.
I've heard that lots of times.

318
00:18:26,047 --> 00:18:28,880
Everywhere we go, two words, following us.

319
00:18:29,847 --> 00:18:31,041
Bad Wolf.

320
00:18:31,127 --> 00:18:33,322
How can they be following us?

321
00:18:36,047 --> 00:18:37,400
No, just a coincidence.

322
00:18:37,487 --> 00:18:40,604
Like hearing a word on the radio
then hearing it all day. Never mind.

323
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:43,247
Things to do.
Margaret, we're gonna take you home.

324
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,602
Hold on, isn't that the easy option?
Like letting her go?

325
00:18:45,687 --> 00:18:48,565
I don't believe it, we actually get to go to Rexi....

326
00:18:48,647 --> 00:18:51,445
Wait a minute, Rexicor....

327
00:18:51,527 --> 00:18:53,006
Rexicoricophalvitorius.

328
00:18:53,087 --> 00:18:55,237
-Rexicorico....
-Phalvitorius.

329
00:18:55,327 --> 00:18:58,125
-Rexicoricophalvitorius!
-That's it!

330
00:18:58,847 --> 00:18:59,962
I did it!

331
00:19:00,047 --> 00:19:02,197
They have the death penalty.

332
00:19:06,607 --> 00:19:10,361
The family Slitheen
was tried in its absence many years ago

333
00:19:10,447 --> 00:19:12,085
and found guilty.

334
00:19:12,327 --> 00:19:14,318
With no chance of appeal.

335
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:19,161
According to the statutes of government,
the moment I return, I'm to be executed.

336
00:19:19,807 --> 00:19:22,196
What do you make of that, Doctor?

337
00:19:23,887 --> 00:19:26,685
Take me home and you take me to my death.

338
00:19:26,887 --> 00:19:28,400
Not my problem.

339
00:19:35,287 --> 00:19:37,278
(MARGARET) This ship is impossible!

340
00:19:38,447 --> 00:19:39,846
It's superb!

341
00:19:39,967 --> 00:19:42,401
How do you get the outside around the inside?

342
00:19:42,527 --> 00:19:44,995
Like I'd give you the secret, yeah.

343
00:19:45,407 --> 00:19:47,921
I almost feel better about being defeated.

344
00:19:48,007 --> 00:19:49,645
I never stood a chance.

345
00:19:49,727 --> 00:19:52,241
This is the technology of the gods.

346
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:54,563
Don't worship me, I'd make a very bad god.

347
00:19:54,647 --> 00:19:56,877
You wouldn't get a day off, for starters.

348
00:19:56,967 --> 00:19:58,798
Jack, how we doing, big fella?

349
00:19:58,887 --> 00:20:02,596
This extrapolator's top of the range.
Where did you get it?

350
00:20:03,167 --> 00:20:05,556
I don't know, some airlock sale.

351
00:20:05,687 --> 00:20:09,475
Must've been a great, big heist.
It's stacked with power.

352
00:20:09,567 --> 00:20:12,479
-But we can use it for fuel?
-It's not compatible.

353
00:20:12,567 --> 00:20:15,081
But it should knock off about 1 2 hours.

354
00:20:15,167 --> 00:20:19,160
-We'll be ready to go by morning.
-Then we're stuck here, overnight.

355
00:20:19,247 --> 00:20:20,600
I'm in no hurry.

356
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:22,245
(ROSE) We've got a prisoner.

357
00:20:22,327 --> 00:20:25,444
The police box is really a police box.

358
00:20:26,127 --> 00:20:28,436
You're not just police, though.

359
00:20:29,087 --> 00:20:33,205
Since you're taking me to my death,
that makes you my executioners.

360
00:20:34,527 --> 00:20:36,563
Each and every one of you.

361
00:20:37,687 --> 00:20:39,245
You deserve it.

362
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,642
You're very quick to say so.

363
00:20:43,087 --> 00:20:45,806
And you're very quick
to soak your hands in my blood.

364
00:20:45,887 --> 00:20:48,879
Which makes you better than me how, exactly?

365
00:20:50,927 --> 00:20:52,599
Long night ahead.

366
00:21:07,647 --> 00:21:10,241
Let's see who can look me in the eye.

367
00:21:38,007 --> 00:21:39,918
It's freezing out here.

368
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:43,364
Better than in there.

369
00:21:46,047 --> 00:21:49,357
She does deserve it, she's a Slitheen,
I don't care.

370
00:21:49,567 --> 00:21:52,684
It's just weird in that box.

371
00:21:54,167 --> 00:21:56,556
I didn't really need my passport.

372
00:22:04,767 --> 00:22:08,919
I've been thinking, you know,
we could go have a drink.

373
00:22:10,207 --> 00:22:12,880
Have a pizza or something, just you and me.

374
00:22:12,967 --> 00:22:14,844
That'd be nice.

375
00:22:14,927 --> 00:22:18,442
And, I mean, if the Tardis
can't leave until morning....

376
00:22:21,607 --> 00:22:24,440
We could go to a hotel. Spend the night.

377
00:22:24,607 --> 00:22:27,280
I mean, if you want to. I've got some money.

378
00:22:27,367 --> 00:22:28,720
Okay, yeah.

379
00:22:28,887 --> 00:22:30,878
-Is that all right?
-Yeah.

380
00:22:33,567 --> 00:22:37,719
Cool, there's a couple of bars round here,
we should give them a go.

381
00:22:38,247 --> 00:22:40,522
Do you have to go and tell him?

382
00:22:40,767 --> 00:22:42,803
It's none of his business.

383
00:22:47,087 --> 00:22:48,566
So, what's on?

384
00:22:49,127 --> 00:22:50,924
Nothing, just....

385
00:22:55,087 --> 00:22:57,555
I gather it's not always like this.

386
00:22:58,847 --> 00:23:00,519
Having to wait.

387
00:23:06,287 --> 00:23:09,165
I bet you're always the first to leave, Doctor.

388
00:23:09,247 --> 00:23:11,966
Never mind the consequences, off you go.

389
00:23:12,167 --> 00:23:16,080
You butchered my family
and then ran for the stars, am I right?

390
00:23:16,607 --> 00:23:19,041
But not this time.

391
00:23:19,167 --> 00:23:21,442
At last, you have consequences.

392
00:23:23,727 --> 00:23:26,480
-How does it feel?
-I didn't butcher them.

393
00:23:26,567 --> 00:23:28,558
Don't answer back, that's what she wants.

394
00:23:28,647 --> 00:23:30,478
I didn't. What about you?

395
00:23:30,567 --> 00:23:34,606
You had an emergency teleport,
you didn't zap them to safety, did you?

396
00:23:34,687 --> 00:23:36,484
It only carries one.

397
00:23:36,927 --> 00:23:38,724
I had to fly without coordinates.

398
00:23:38,807 --> 00:23:41,605
I ended up in a skip on the Isle of Dogs.

399
00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:43,359
(DOCTOR LAUGHING)

400
00:23:43,447 --> 00:23:45,642
-It wasn't funny.
-Sorry.

401
00:23:49,487 --> 00:23:51,159
It is a bit funny.

402
00:23:55,927 --> 00:23:57,883
Do I get a last request?

403
00:23:58,847 --> 00:24:00,599
Depends what it is.

404
00:24:01,087 --> 00:24:03,681
I grew quite fond of my little human life.

405
00:24:03,767 --> 00:24:05,439
All those rituals.

406
00:24:05,687 --> 00:24:09,521
The brushing of the teeth
and the complicated way they cook things.

407
00:24:09,607 --> 00:24:12,724
There's a little restaurant, just round the Bay.

408
00:24:12,807 --> 00:24:15,321
It became quite a favourite of mine.

409
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:23,437
-Is that what you want? A last meal?
-Don't I have rights?

410
00:24:23,527 --> 00:24:25,563
Like she's not gonna try to escape.

411
00:24:25,647 --> 00:24:29,435
Except I can never escape the Doctor
so where's the danger?

412
00:24:33,407 --> 00:24:35,602
I wonder if you could do it.

413
00:24:37,487 --> 00:24:41,275
To sit with a creature you're about to kill
and take supper.

414
00:24:43,927 --> 00:24:47,363
-How strong is your stomach?
-Strong enough.

415
00:24:47,647 --> 00:24:48,921
I wonder.

416
00:24:50,047 --> 00:24:52,436
I've seen you fight your enemies.

417
00:24:53,727 --> 00:24:55,479
Now dine with them.

418
00:24:57,047 --> 00:24:59,561
-You won't change my mind.
-Prove it.

419
00:25:03,207 --> 00:25:05,323
There are people out there.

420
00:25:05,567 --> 00:25:08,286
If you slip away just for one second,
they'll be in danger.

421
00:25:08,367 --> 00:25:10,835
Except, I've got these.

422
00:25:11,967 --> 00:25:13,446
You both wear one.

423
00:25:13,527 --> 00:25:16,166
If she moves more than ten feet away....

424
00:25:18,167 --> 00:25:20,681
She gets zapped by 1 0,000 volts.

425
00:25:21,967 --> 00:25:25,562
Margaret, would you like to come out
to dinner? My treat.

426
00:25:27,927 --> 00:25:29,599
Dinner in bondage.

427
00:25:31,847 --> 00:25:33,326
Works for me.

428
00:26:09,927 --> 00:26:13,476
Here we are, out on a date, and
you haven't even asked my proper name.

429
00:26:13,567 --> 00:26:15,159
It's not a date.

430
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:18,198
-What's your name?
-Blon.

431
00:26:19,287 --> 00:26:22,165
I'm Blon Fel Fotch Passameer-Day Slitheen

432
00:26:23,807 --> 00:26:26,480
That's what it'll say on my death certificate.

433
00:26:26,647 --> 00:26:29,081
-Nice to meet you, Blon.
-I'm sure.

434
00:26:31,087 --> 00:26:33,601
Look, that's where I was living as Margaret.

435
00:26:33,687 --> 00:26:36,440
Nice little flat, over there on the top.

436
00:26:37,247 --> 00:26:39,044
Next to the one with the light on.

437
00:26:39,127 --> 00:26:43,166
Two bedrooms, bayside view. I was rather content.

438
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:46,042
Don't suppose I'll see it again.

439
00:26:50,127 --> 00:26:51,526
Suppose not.

440
00:26:52,967 --> 00:26:54,958
-Thank you.
-Pleasure.

441
00:26:57,247 --> 00:27:00,683
Tell me, then, Doctor,
what do you know of our species?

442
00:27:01,047 --> 00:27:02,799
Only what I've seen.

443
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:04,798
Did you know, for example,

444
00:27:04,887 --> 00:27:06,957
in extreme cases,

445
00:27:07,047 --> 00:27:09,880
when her life is in danger,

446
00:27:09,967 --> 00:27:13,164
a female Rexicoricophalvitorian
can manufacture a poison dart

447
00:27:13,247 --> 00:27:15,078
within her own finger.

448
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:16,686
Yes, I did.

449
00:27:17,367 --> 00:27:18,880
Just checking.

450
00:27:19,927 --> 00:27:21,645
And one more thing.

451
00:27:21,847 --> 00:27:23,565
Between you and me....

452
00:27:30,287 --> 00:27:35,077
(WHISPERING) As a final resort, the excess
poison can be exhaled through the lungs.

453
00:27:36,967 --> 00:27:39,527
That's better. Now then, what do you think?

454
00:27:39,607 --> 00:27:41,598
Steak looks nice.

455
00:27:41,687 --> 00:27:43,279
Steak and chips!

456
00:27:48,047 --> 00:27:50,356
(ROSE) The Doctor took me
to this planet a while back.

457
00:27:50,447 --> 00:27:52,278
It was much colder than this.

458
00:27:52,367 --> 00:27:54,437
They called it Woman Wept.

459
00:27:54,567 --> 00:27:56,762
The planet was actually called Woman Wept

460
00:27:56,847 --> 00:27:59,236
because if you looked at it, right, from above,

461
00:27:59,327 --> 00:28:02,842
it was like this huge continent,
like, all curved round.

462
00:28:02,927 --> 00:28:05,919
It sort of looked like a woman,
you know, lamenting.

463
00:28:06,007 --> 00:28:08,157
Oh, my God, and we went to this beach, right.

464
00:28:08,247 --> 00:28:10,397
No people, no buildings,

465
00:28:10,487 --> 00:28:13,240
just this beach, like, 1 ,000 miles across.

466
00:28:13,727 --> 00:28:16,878
And something happened,
something to do with the sun, I don't know,

467
00:28:16,967 --> 00:28:19,322
but the sea had just frozen.

468
00:28:19,407 --> 00:28:20,886
In a split second.

469
00:28:20,967 --> 00:28:24,323
In the middle of a storm, right,
waves and foam, just frozen,

470
00:28:24,407 --> 00:28:26,204
all the way out to the horizon.

471
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:29,085
Midnight, right, we walk underneath these waves,

472
00:28:29,167 --> 00:28:31,806
1 00 feet tall and made of ice.

473
00:28:31,887 --> 00:28:34,355
I'm going out with Trisha Delaney.

474
00:28:37,207 --> 00:28:38,526
Oh, right.

475
00:28:39,767 --> 00:28:41,166
That's nice.

476
00:28:42,367 --> 00:28:45,677
-Trisha from the shop?
-Yeah, Rob Delaney's sister.

477
00:28:46,047 --> 00:28:47,719
Well, she's nice.

478
00:28:48,207 --> 00:28:50,675
-She's a bit big.
-She lost weight.

479
00:28:53,807 --> 00:28:55,604
You've been away.

480
00:28:55,687 --> 00:28:57,996
Well, good for you. She's nice.

481
00:28:59,767 --> 00:29:03,601
-So, tell us more about this planet, then.
-That was it, really.

482
00:29:08,887 --> 00:29:11,276
Public execution is a slow death.

483
00:29:12,727 --> 00:29:17,243
They prepare a thin acetic acid,
lower me into the cauldron...

484
00:29:17,327 --> 00:29:18,760
and boil me.

485
00:29:19,647 --> 00:29:23,196
The acidity is perfectly gauged
to strip away the skin.

486
00:29:23,727 --> 00:29:27,686
Internal organs fall out into the liquid
and I become soup.

487
00:29:28,847 --> 00:29:30,439
And still alive.

488
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:33,325
Still screaming.

489
00:29:33,567 --> 00:29:36,400
-I don't make the law.
-But you deliver it.

490
00:29:37,247 --> 00:29:39,158
Will you stay to watch?

491
00:29:40,127 --> 00:29:41,560
What else can I do?

492
00:29:41,647 --> 00:29:43,717
The Slitheen family's huge.

493
00:29:44,047 --> 00:29:47,562
There's a lot more of us,
all scattered off-world. Take me to them.

494
00:29:47,647 --> 00:29:49,365
Take me somewhere safe.

495
00:29:49,447 --> 00:29:52,086
-But then you'll just start again.
-I promise I won't.

496
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:54,158
You've been in that skin suit too long.

497
00:29:54,247 --> 00:29:57,762
You've forgotten.
There used to be a real Margaret Blaine.

498
00:29:57,847 --> 00:30:00,315
You killed her and stripped her and used the skin.

499
00:30:00,407 --> 00:30:03,365
You're pleading for mercy
out of a dead woman's lips.

500
00:30:03,447 --> 00:30:05,517
Perhaps I have got used to it.

501
00:30:05,607 --> 00:30:07,916
A human life, an ordinary life.

502
00:30:09,447 --> 00:30:11,324
That's all I'm asking.

503
00:30:13,247 --> 00:30:15,238
Give me a chance, Doctor.

504
00:30:16,887 --> 00:30:19,560
-I can change.
-I don't believe you.

505
00:30:21,887 --> 00:30:24,765
-So, what do you want to do now?
-Don't mind.

506
00:30:26,167 --> 00:30:28,522
We could ask about hotels.

507
00:30:28,607 --> 00:30:30,837
What would Trisha Delaney say?

508
00:30:30,967 --> 00:30:32,241
I suppose.

509
00:30:34,407 --> 00:30:36,523
There's a bar down there with a Spanish name....

510
00:30:36,607 --> 00:30:37,960
You don't even like Trisha Delaney!

511
00:30:38,047 --> 00:30:40,003
Is that right?
What the hell do you know?

512
00:30:40,087 --> 00:30:42,157
I know you and I know her

513
00:30:42,247 --> 00:30:44,124
and I know that's never gonna happen.

514
00:30:44,207 --> 00:30:47,882
-So, who do you think you're kidding?
-At least I know where she is!

515
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:50,919
There we are, then.

516
00:30:51,047 --> 00:30:53,925
It's got nothing to do with Trisha.
This is all about me, isn't it?

517
00:30:54,007 --> 00:30:55,406
You left me!

518
00:30:58,007 --> 00:31:00,157
We were nice, we were happy.

519
00:31:01,007 --> 00:31:03,441
And then what? You give me a kiss
and run off with him

520
00:31:03,527 --> 00:31:06,360
and you make me feel like nothing, Rose.
I was nothing!

521
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:08,756
I can't even go out with a stupid girl from a shop

522
00:31:08,847 --> 00:31:12,044
because you pick up the phone
and I comes running.

523
00:31:13,327 --> 00:31:15,795
I mean, is that what I am, Rose, standby?

524
00:31:15,887 --> 00:31:18,879
Am I just supposed to sit here
for the rest of my life waiting for you?

525
00:31:18,967 --> 00:31:21,083
-Because I will.
-I'm sorry.

526
00:31:30,367 --> 00:31:33,723
I promise you I've changed
since we last met, Doctor.

527
00:31:34,447 --> 00:31:36,756
There was this girl, just today.

528
00:31:37,647 --> 00:31:39,080
Young thing.

529
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:43,523
And something of a danger.
She was getting too close.

530
00:31:43,727 --> 00:31:46,366
I felt the blood lust rising,
just as the family taught me.

531
00:31:46,447 --> 00:31:49,325
I was going to kill her without a thought.

532
00:31:49,767 --> 00:31:51,166
And then...

533
00:31:52,687 --> 00:31:54,120
I stopped.

534
00:31:55,607 --> 00:31:57,723
She's alive somewhere, right now.

535
00:31:57,807 --> 00:32:00,640
She's walking round this city
because I can change.

536
00:32:00,727 --> 00:32:02,843
I did change.

537
00:32:02,927 --> 00:32:05,566
-I know I can't prove it.
-I believe you.

538
00:32:05,847 --> 00:32:08,361
Then you know I'm capable of better.

539
00:32:08,487 --> 00:32:10,159
It doesn't mean anything.

540
00:32:10,247 --> 00:32:12,317
I spared her life.

541
00:32:12,407 --> 00:32:15,285
You let one of them go. But that's nothing new.

542
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:17,642
Every now and then a little victim's spared.

543
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:20,719
Because she smiled. Because he's got freckles.

544
00:32:21,167 --> 00:32:22,919
Because they begged.

545
00:32:23,727 --> 00:32:25,957
And that's how you live with yourself.

546
00:32:26,047 --> 00:32:28,515
That's how you slaughter millions.

547
00:32:28,967 --> 00:32:34,280
Because once in a while, on a whim,
if the wind's in the right direction...

548
00:32:34,407 --> 00:32:35,920
you happen to be kind.

549
00:32:36,007 --> 00:32:38,396
Only a killer would know that.

550
00:32:38,487 --> 00:32:39,886
Is that right?

551
00:32:39,967 --> 00:32:41,320
From what I've seen,

552
00:32:41,407 --> 00:32:45,082
your funny little happy-go-lucky life
leaves devastation in its wake.

553
00:32:45,167 --> 00:32:48,443
Always moving on because you dare not go back.

554
00:32:48,527 --> 00:32:52,486
Playing with so many people's lives,
you might as well be a god.

555
00:32:54,287 --> 00:32:56,278
And you're right, Doctor.

556
00:32:56,887 --> 00:32:58,366
You're absolutely right.

557
00:32:58,447 --> 00:33:01,644
Sometimes, you let one go.

558
00:33:04,767 --> 00:33:06,166
Let me go.

559
00:33:12,247 --> 00:33:15,717
I'm not asking you to leave him
because I know that's not fair.

560
00:33:15,807 --> 00:33:18,196
But I just need something, yeah,
some sort of promise

561
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:20,755
that when you do come back,
you're coming back for me.

562
00:33:20,847 --> 00:33:22,246
(RUMBLING)

563
00:33:22,327 --> 00:33:25,000
-Is that thunder?
-Does it matter?

564
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:26,805
That's not thunder.

565
00:33:27,727 --> 00:33:30,321
In the family Slitheen, we had no choice.

566
00:33:30,407 --> 00:33:32,875
I was made to carry out my first kill at 1 3.

567
00:33:32,967 --> 00:33:36,039
If I'd refused, my father would have fed me
to the Venom Grubs.

568
00:33:36,127 --> 00:33:39,278
If I'm a killer, it's because I was born to kill.
It's all I know.

569
00:33:39,367 --> 00:33:40,766
(RUMBLING)

570
00:33:40,847 --> 00:33:43,315
Doctor, are you even listening to me?

571
00:33:43,407 --> 00:33:45,796
-Can you hear that?
-I'm begging for my life.

572
00:33:45,887 --> 00:33:47,525
No, listen, shush.

573
00:33:54,087 --> 00:33:55,566
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

574
00:33:58,327 --> 00:33:59,885
Go on, then, run.

575
00:34:00,007 --> 00:34:02,680
It's him again, isn't it? It's the Doctor.
It's always the Doctor.

576
00:34:02,767 --> 00:34:05,839
It's always gonna be the Doctor. It's never me!

577
00:34:06,847 --> 00:34:08,280
The handcuffs!

578
00:34:12,687 --> 00:34:16,316
-Don't think you're running away.
-I'm sticking with you.

579
00:34:16,447 --> 00:34:18,756
Some date this turned out to be!

580
00:34:31,847 --> 00:34:34,315
It's the rift. The rift's opening.

581
00:34:56,047 --> 00:34:58,356
(DOCTOR) What the hell are you doing?
(JACK) It just went crazy!

582
00:34:58,447 --> 00:35:01,439
It's the rift. Time and space are ripping apart.

583
00:35:01,567 --> 00:35:03,956
The whole city's going to disappear.

584
00:35:16,287 --> 00:35:18,005
(CRASHING)

585
00:35:37,487 --> 00:35:38,840
It's the extrapolator.

586
00:35:38,927 --> 00:35:42,203
I've disconnected it,
but it's still feeding off the engine.

587
00:35:42,287 --> 00:35:44,562
It's using the Tardis, I can't stop it.

588
00:35:44,647 --> 00:35:46,956
Never mind Cardiff,
it's gonna rip open the planet!

589
00:35:47,047 --> 00:35:49,038
What is it? What's happening?

590
00:35:49,127 --> 00:35:51,083
Just little me.

591
00:35:53,727 --> 00:35:56,878
One wrong move and she snaps like a promise.

592
00:35:56,967 --> 00:35:58,286
I might have known.

593
00:35:58,367 --> 00:36:02,246
I've had you bleating all night, poor baby.

594
00:36:02,447 --> 00:36:03,641
Now, shut it.

595
00:36:03,727 --> 00:36:05,957
You, fly boy.

596
00:36:06,047 --> 00:36:08,402
Put the extrapolator at my feet.

597
00:36:21,727 --> 00:36:23,080
Thank you.

598
00:36:24,447 --> 00:36:26,244
Just as I planned.

599
00:36:26,567 --> 00:36:29,320
I thought you needed to blow up
the nuclear power station.

600
00:36:29,407 --> 00:36:32,877
Failing that, if I were to be arrested,

601
00:36:32,967 --> 00:36:35,197
then anyone capable of tracking me down

602
00:36:35,287 --> 00:36:38,165
would have considerable technology of their own.

603
00:36:38,247 --> 00:36:42,957
Therefore, they would be
captivated by the extrapolator.

604
00:36:44,047 --> 00:36:47,039
Especially a magpie-mind like yours, Doctor.

605
00:36:47,767 --> 00:36:51,680
So, the extrapolator
was programmed to go to Plan B.

606
00:36:52,367 --> 00:36:55,006
To lock on to the nearest alien power source

607
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:57,157
and open the rift.

608
00:36:58,207 --> 00:37:01,165
And what a power source it found.

609
00:37:01,607 --> 00:37:03,563
I'm back on schedule.

610
00:37:05,047 --> 00:37:06,844
Thanks to you.

611
00:37:07,047 --> 00:37:09,641
The rift's gonna convulse,
you'll destroy the whole planet.

612
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,319
And you with it.

613
00:37:12,887 --> 00:37:17,517
While I ride this board
over the crest of the inferno,

614
00:37:17,607 --> 00:37:19,677
all the way to freedom.

615
00:37:21,327 --> 00:37:23,522
Stand back, boys.

616
00:37:24,327 --> 00:37:25,806
Surf's up.

617
00:37:38,847 --> 00:37:41,919
Of course, opening the rift
means you'll pull this ship apart.

618
00:37:42,007 --> 00:37:43,486
So sue me.

619
00:37:44,127 --> 00:37:45,845
It's not just any old power source.

620
00:37:45,927 --> 00:37:48,202
It's the Tardis, my Tardis.

621
00:37:48,847 --> 00:37:50,724
The best ship in the universe.

622
00:37:50,807 --> 00:37:52,877
It'll make wonderful scrap.

623
00:37:53,207 --> 00:37:56,244
-What's that light?
-The heart of the Tardis.

624
00:37:56,727 --> 00:37:58,399
This ship's alive.

625
00:37:58,647 --> 00:38:00,558
You've opened its soul.

626
00:38:05,247 --> 00:38:09,240
It's...so bright.

627
00:38:10,607 --> 00:38:12,404
Look at it, Margaret.

628
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:14,520
Beautiful.

629
00:38:14,927 --> 00:38:17,282
Look inside, Blon Fel Fotch.

630
00:38:18,367 --> 00:38:20,085
Look at the light.

631
00:38:49,047 --> 00:38:50,526
Thank you.

632
00:39:01,447 --> 00:39:04,200
Don't look, stay there, close your eyes!

633
00:39:05,807 --> 00:39:08,196
Now, Jack, come on, shut it all down. Shut down.

634
00:39:08,287 --> 00:39:12,075
Rose, that panel over there,
turn all switches to the right.

635
00:39:27,247 --> 00:39:29,397
(DOCTOR) Nicely done. Thank you, all.

636
00:39:30,007 --> 00:39:31,759
(ROSE) What happened to Margaret?

637
00:39:31,847 --> 00:39:34,202
(JACK) Must've got burned up.
Carried out her own death sentence.

638
00:39:34,287 --> 00:39:36,482
No, I don't think she's dead.

639
00:39:36,647 --> 00:39:38,080
Then where'd she go?

640
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:41,762
She looked into the heart of the Tardis.
Even I don't know how strong that is.

641
00:39:41,847 --> 00:39:43,838
And the ship's telepathic, like I told you, Rose.

642
00:39:43,927 --> 00:39:47,158
Gets inside your head, translates alien languages.

643
00:39:48,087 --> 00:39:51,682
Maybe the raw energy can translate
all sorts of thoughts.

644
00:39:57,047 --> 00:39:59,515
-Here she is.
-She's an egg?

645
00:39:59,607 --> 00:40:02,440
-Regressed to her childhood.
-She's an egg?

646
00:40:02,607 --> 00:40:04,962
She can start again. Live her life from scratch.

647
00:40:05,047 --> 00:40:07,083
If we take her home,
give her to a different family,

648
00:40:07,167 --> 00:40:09,601
tell them to bring her up properly,
she might be all right.

649
00:40:09,687 --> 00:40:11,598
-Or she might be worse.
-That's her choice.

650
00:40:11,687 --> 00:40:13,837
-She's an egg.
-She's an egg.

651
00:40:15,407 --> 00:40:17,045
Oh, my God, Mickey.

652
00:41:07,647 --> 00:41:11,083
We're all powered up, we can leave.
Opening the rift filled us up with energy.

653
00:41:11,167 --> 00:41:13,920
-We can go. If that's all right.
-Yeah, fine.

654
00:41:16,327 --> 00:41:18,841
-How's Mickey?
-He's okay. He's gone.

655
00:41:19,287 --> 00:41:22,120
Do you want to go and find him? We'll wait.

656
00:41:22,327 --> 00:41:24,477
No need. He deserves better.

657
00:41:25,727 --> 00:41:28,195
Off we go, then. Always moving on.

658
00:41:28,567 --> 00:41:31,081
Next stop, Rexicoricophalvitorius.

659
00:41:31,527 --> 00:41:33,119
Now, you don't often get to say that.

660
00:41:33,207 --> 00:41:35,084
We'll just stop by and pop her in the hatchery.

661
00:41:35,167 --> 00:41:39,080
Margaret the Slitheen can live her life again.
A second chance.

662
00:41:39,647 --> 00:41:41,205
That'd be nice.

663
00:41:45,767 --> 00:41:47,564
(WHOOSHING)

664
00:41:57,687 --> 00:41:59,643
You got chosen, you're a housemate.

665
00:41:59,727 --> 00:42:02,366
You're in the house, isn't that brilliant?

<i>Welcome to the Weakest Link.</i>

We are giving you a brand-new image.

668
00:42:07,927 --> 00:42:10,157
Why? Is there something wrong
with what I'm wearing?

669
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:13,045
-What was that?
-She's been evicted.

670
00:42:15,727 --> 00:42:16,762
This isn't just a game.

671
00:42:16,847 --> 00:42:19,884
I need to find the Doctor,
he's here somewhere, he's always here!

672
00:42:19,967 --> 00:42:21,286
There's something else going on.

673
00:42:21,367 --> 00:42:23,437
(MAN) We have contestants outside the games.

674
00:42:23,527 --> 00:42:24,846
