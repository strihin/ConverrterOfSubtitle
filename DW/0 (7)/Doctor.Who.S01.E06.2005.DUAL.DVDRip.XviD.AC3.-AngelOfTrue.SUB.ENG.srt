it's from the hull of a spacecraft.

00:12:15,766 --> 00:12:19,884
I'd give anything. I don't think
it'll happen - not in our lifetime.

171
00:12:20,046 --> 00:12:25,678
You never know. What about all those people
who say they've been inside spaceships

172
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:27,325
and talked to aliens?

173
00:12:27,486 --> 00:12:29,477
I think they're nutters.

174
00:12:29,646 --> 00:12:32,444
- Yeah. Me too!
- (THEY LAUGH)

175
00:12:33,606 --> 00:12:38,361
- How did you end up here?
- Geniuses from all over the world come here.

00:12:38,526 --> 00:12:40,437
Oh, right. You're a genius.

177

Sorry, but yeah. I can't help it.
I was born clever.

178
00:12:44,326 --> 00:12:47,921
When I was eight,
I logged on to the US defence system.

179
00:12:48,086 --> 00:12:51,203
- Nearly caused World War Three.
- Is that funny?

180
00:12:51,366 --> 00:12:54,995
You should have seen them running about.
Fantastic!

181
00:12:56,406 --> 00:12:59,239
- You sound like the Doctor.
- Are you and him...?

182
00:12:59,406 --> 00:13:01,795
- No, we're just friends.
- Good.

183
00:13:01,966 --> 00:13:03,763
Why is that good?

184
00:13:03,926 --> 00:13:05,598
Just is.

185
00:13:08,086 --> 00:13:11,681
So... Wouldn't you rather be downstairs?

186
00:13:11,846 --> 00:13:17,125
You've got these bits of metal, but
Mr Van Statten's got a living creature down there.

187
00:13:17,286 --> 00:13:20,722
Yeah. I did ask, but he keeps it to himself.

188
00:13:21,446 --> 00:13:26,759
Although, if you're a genius, it doesn't take long
to patch through on the comms system.

189

It doesn't do much - the alien.

191
00:13:34,006 --> 00:13:36,395
It's weird. It's kind of useless.

192

195
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:55,355
- I don't know.
- Take me down there now.

196
00:13:57,126 --> 00:14:01,324
(DOCTOR) The metal is armour.
The creature's inside. It's a mutation.

197
00:14:01,486 --> 00:14:06,640
The Dalek race was genetically engineered.
Every emotion was removed except hate.

198
00:14:06,806 --> 00:14:09,366
Genetically engineered by whom?

199
00:14:09,526 --> 00:14:13,599
By a genius, a man who was king
of his own world. You'd like him.

200

It's been on Earth for over 50 years,
sold from one collection to another.

201
00:14:18,806 --> 00:14:22,560
- Why is it a threat now?
- Because I'm here. How did it reach Earth?

202
00:14:22,726 --> 00:14:27,595
Records say it came from the sky
like a meteorite. It hit the Ascension Islands.

203
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:32,317
It burnt in its crater for three days.
In all that time, it was screaming.

204
00:14:32,486 --> 00:14:34,602
It must have gone insane.

205
00:14:35,526 --> 00:14:39,439
- It fell through time. The only survivor.
- You mentioned a war.

206
00:14:39,606 --> 00:14:43,281
The Time War. The battle
between my people and the Dalek race.

207
00:14:43,446 --> 00:14:46,563
- But you survived, too.
- Not by choice.

208
00:14:46,726 --> 00:14:51,800
This means the Dalek isn't the only alien
on Earth, Doctor. There's you.

209
00:14:51,966 --> 00:14:55,197

for centuries.

Oh, the advances I've made from alien junk!
You have no idea, Doctor.

218
00:15:35,446 --> 00:15:41,885
Last year, my scientists cultivated bacteria from
the Russian crater. Do you know what we found?

The cure for the common cold.

220
00:15:46,766 --> 00:15:49,326
Kept it within the laboratory, of course.

221
00:15:49,486 --> 00:15:54,480
No need to get people excited. Why sell
one cure when I can sell 1,000 palliatives?

222
00:15:54,646 --> 00:15:57,160
Do you know what a Dalek is, Van Statten?

223
00:15:58,526 --> 00:16:03,281
A Dalek is honest. It does what it was born to do
for the survival of its species.

224
00:16:03,446 --> 00:16:05,835
That creature is better than you.

In that case, I will be true to myself
and continue.

00:27:17,726 --> 00:27:19,762
Fall back!

336
00:27:48,646 --> 00:27:52,719
Maybe we should consider
abandoning this place.

337
00:27:52,886 --> 00:27:55,081
There's no power to the helipad.

338
00:27:55,246 --> 00:27:58,318
- We can't get out.
- You said we could seal the Vault.

339
00:27:58,486 --> 00:28:03,401
It was designed to be a bunker in a nuclear war.
Steel bulkheads close off the area.

340
00:28:03,566 --> 00:28:07,036
- There's not enough power.
- Reroute the emergency power.

341
00:28:07,206 --> 00:28:11,085
- We'd need a computer genius.
- Good thing you've got me, then!

342
00:28:11,246 --> 00:28:14,397
- You want to help?
- I don't want to die, Doctor.

343
00:28:14,566 --> 00:28:18,320
- Nobody knows this software better than me.
- Sir...

344
00:28:19,366 --> 00:28:24,486
<i>(DALEK) I shall speak only to the Doctor.</i>

345
00:28:28,886 --> 00:28:30,444
You're gonna get rusty.

346
00:28:30,606 --> 00:28:36,602
<i>(DALEK) I fed off the DNA of Rose Tyler.</i>

347
00:28:36,766 --> 00:28:44,480
<i>Extrapolating the biomass</i>
<i>of a time traveller regenerated me.</i>

348
00:28:44,646 --> 00:28:50,482
- What's your next trick?
- <i>I have been searching for the Daleks.</i>

349
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:54,958
Yeah, I saw - downloading the internet.
What did you find?

350
00:28:55,126 --> 00:29:01,201
- I scanned your satellites and radio telescopes.
- And?

351
00:29:01,366 --> 00:29:03,926
<i>(DALEK) Nothing.</i>

352
00:29:04,086 --> 00:29:07,078
<i>(FRENZIED CRY)</i>
<i>Where shall I get my orders now?</i>

353
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:13,481
- You're just a soldier without commands.
- Then I shall follow the Primary Order -

354
00:29:13,646 --> 00:29:17,605
the Dalek instinct to destroy, to conquer!

355
00:29:17,766 --> 00:29:19,722
What for? What's the point?

356
00:29:22,966 --> 00:29:27,835
Don't you see it's all gone?
Everything you were, everything you stood for.

357
00:29:29,006 --> 00:29:33,045
(DALEK) Then what should I do?

358
00:29:34,286 --> 00:29:36,277
All right, then.

359
00:29:36,446 --> 00:29:38,960
If you want orders, follow this one.

360
00:29:42,166 --> 00:29:45,078
- Kill yourself.
- The Daleks must survive!

361
00:29:45,246 --> 00:29:49,478
The Daleks have failed.
Why don't you make the Daleks extinct,

362
00:29:49,646 --> 00:29:53,116
rid the universe of your filth?
Why don't you just die?

363
00:29:55,926 --> 00:29:59,475
You would make a good Dalek.

364
00:30:06,326 --> 00:30:07,759
Seal the Vault.

365
00:30:16,206 --> 00:30:19,881
I'll feed power from the ground defences
to the bulkheads.

366
00:30:20,046 --> 00:30:23,675
- It's years since I've worked so fast!
- Having fun?

367
00:30:23,846 --> 00:30:26,121
She's still down there.

368
00:30:26,286 --> 00:30:29,801
- (PHONE RINGS)
- (ROSE) This isn't the best time.

369
00:30:29,966 --> 00:30:32,605
- <i>(D0CT0R) Where are you?</i>
- Level 49.

370
00:30:32,766 --> 00:30:36,361
Keep moving.
The Vault's being sealed off up at level 46.

371
00:30:36,526 --> 00:30:40,644
- Can't you stop 'em closing?
- I can't wait and I can't help you.

372
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:43,718
<i>(D0CT0R) Now, for God's sake, run!</i>

373
00:30:50,366 --> 00:30:53,756
- Done it. We've got power.
- The Dalek's behind them.

374
00:30:53,926 --> 00:30:56,076
Nearly there. Give us two seconds.

375
00:30:56,246 --> 00:31:01,081
I can't sustain the power. The system is failing.
We have to close the bulkheads.

376
00:31:10,686 --> 00:31:12,836
I'm sorry.

377
00:31:13,006 --> 00:31:14,997
(WHIRRING)

378
00:31:18,006 --> 00:31:21,237
- Come on!
- (BEEPING AND WHIRRING)

379
00:31:39,286 --> 00:31:40,685
The Vault is sealed.

380
00:31:41,606 --> 00:31:44,074
Rose, where are you? Did you make it?

381
00:31:49,406 --> 00:31:50,998
Sorry. I was a bit slow.

382
00:32:02,646 --> 00:32:04,716
See you, then, Doctor.

383
00:32:08,006 --> 00:32:12,238
It wasn't your fault.
Remember that, OK? It wasn't your fault.

384
00:32:13,486 --> 00:32:14,885
<i>And do you know what?</i>

385
00:32:16,446 --> 00:32:19,836
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.

386
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:32,318
- <i>(DALEK) Exterminate!</i>
- <i>(SIZZLING BLAST)</i>

387
00:32:34,566 --> 00:32:37,364
- I killed her.
- I'm sorry.

388
00:32:38,766 --> 00:32:43,157
I said I'd protect her. She was only here
because of me, and you're sorry?

389
00:32:43,326 --> 00:32:47,239
I could have killed that Dalek in its cell,
but you stopped me.

390
00:32:47,406 --> 00:32:50,842
- It was the prize of my collection.
- Was it worth it?

391
00:32:51,006 --> 00:32:54,476
Worth all those men's deaths? Worth Rose?

392
00:32:54,646 --> 00:32:58,480
Let me tell you something.
Mankind goes into space to explore.

393
00:32:58,646 --> 00:33:03,276
- To be part of something greater.
- Exactly! I wanted to touch the stars.

394
00:33:03,446 --> 00:33:08,315
You just want to drag the stars down,
underground underneath tons of sand and dirt,

395
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:09,999
and label them.

396
00:33:10,166 --> 00:33:12,805
You're as far from the stars as you can get.

397
00:33:18,006 --> 00:33:20,520
And you took her down with you.

398
00:33:21,486 --> 00:33:23,920
She was 19 years old.

399
00:33:32,846 --> 00:33:34,802
Go on, then. Kill me.

400
00:33:36,966 --> 00:33:38,399
Why are you doing this?

401
00:33:38,566 --> 00:33:42,241
I am armed. I will kill.

402
00:33:42,406 --> 00:33:46,922
- It is my purpose.
- They're all dead because of you.

403
00:33:47,086 --> 00:33:50,761
They are dead because of us.

404
00:33:54,206 --> 00:33:57,198
And now what? What are you waiting for?

405
00:33:57,366 --> 00:34:01,837
I feel your fear.

406
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:03,325
What do you expect?

407
00:34:03,486 --> 00:34:07,320
Daleks do not fear. Must not fear.

408
00:34:10,406 --> 00:34:13,478
You gave me life.

409
00:34:13,646 --> 00:34:17,924
What else have you given me?

410
00:34:18,086 --> 00:34:21,237
I am contaminated.

411
00:34:22,966 --> 00:34:27,164
- You were quick on your feet (!)
- I'm not the one who sealed the Vault.

412
00:34:27,326 --> 00:34:32,195
<i>(DALEK) 0pen the bulkhead or Rose Tyler dies.</i>

413
00:34:33,326 --> 00:34:35,715

<i>Can't get rid of me (!)</i>

415
00:34:37,726 --> 00:34:39,398
I thought you were dead.

<i>(DALEK) 0pen the bulkhead!</i>
<i>(R0SE) Don't do it.</i>

00:34:45,846 --> 00:34:51,876
<i>if you will not save the woman you love?</i>

419
00:34:56,526 --> 00:34:58,357
I killed her once.

420
00:34:59,446 --> 00:35:01,914
I can't do it again.

421
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:20,955
What do we do now, you bleeding heart?
What the hell do we do?

422
00:35:21,126 --> 00:35:24,801
- Kill it.
- The alien weapons are in the Vault.

423
00:35:24,966 --> 00:35:27,685
Only the catalogued ones.

424
00:35:31,286 --> 00:35:32,685
Broken.

425
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:35,838
Broken.

426
00:35:36,006 --> 00:35:37,837
Hairdryer.

427
00:35:38,006 --> 00:35:40,839
Mr Van Statten tends to wipe people's memory.

428
00:35:41,006 --> 00:35:44,282
I kept this in case I needed
to fight my way out one day.

429
00:35:44,446 --> 00:35:46,721
- What, YOU in a fight?
- I could do.

430
00:35:46,886 --> 00:35:49,480
Are you gonna throw your A levels at 'em (?)

431
00:35:49,646 --> 00:35:51,477
Oh, yes.

432
00:35:51,646 --> 00:35:54,001
Lock and load!

433
00:36:02,726 --> 00:36:06,514
- Don't kill 'em. You didn't kill me.
- But why not?

434
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:08,963
Why are you alive?

435
00:36:09,126 --> 00:36:11,481
My function is to kill.

436
00:36:11,646 --> 00:36:13,443
What am I?

437
00:36:13,606 --> 00:36:15,198
What am I?

438
00:36:22,326 --> 00:36:25,841
Don't move. It's beginning to question itself.

439
00:36:26,886 --> 00:36:31,118
(DALEK) Van Statten, you tortured me.

440
00:36:31,286 --> 00:36:34,039
- Why?
- I wanted to help you.

441
00:36:34,206 --> 00:36:40,759
I don't know. I thought if we could get through
to you, we could mend you. I wanted you better.

442
00:36:40,926 --> 00:36:44,635
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I swear.
I just wanted you to talk!

443
00:36:44,806 --> 00:36:48,355
(DALEK) Then hear me talk now. Exterminate!

444
00:36:48,526 --> 00:36:51,882
(FRENZIED CRY) Exterminate! Exterminate!

445
00:36:52,046 --> 00:36:53,923
Don't do it. Don't kill him!

446
00:36:55,206 --> 00:36:57,401
You don't have to do this anymore.

447
00:36:57,566 --> 00:37:03,277
There must be something else, not just killing.
What else is there? What do you want?

448
00:37:08,686 --> 00:37:12,395
I want freedom.

449
00:37:51,046 --> 00:37:53,924
You're out. You made it.

450
00:37:57,606 --> 00:38:05,604
- I never thought I'd feel the sunlight again.
- How...does...it...feel?

451
00:38:06,686 --> 00:38:08,677
(WHIRRING)

452
00:38:38,806 --> 00:38:41,366
(DOCTOR) Get out of the way!

453
00:38:44,326 --> 00:38:45,725
Get out of the way now!

454
00:38:45,886 --> 00:38:50,641
- No. I won't let you do this.
- That thing killed hundreds of people.

455
00:38:50,806 --> 00:38:53,195
It's not the one pointing the gun at me.

456
00:38:53,366 --> 00:38:57,962
I've got to do this. I've got to end it.
The Daleks destroyed my home, my people.

457
00:38:58,126 --> 00:39:01,835
- I've got nothing left.
- Look at it.

458
00:39:04,286 --> 00:39:06,481
What's it doing?

459
00:39:08,406 --> 00:39:10,078
It wants the sunlight.

460
00:39:10,246 --> 00:39:13,318
- It can't...
- It couldn't kill Van Statten or me.

461
00:39:13,486 --> 00:39:14,805
It's changing.

462
00:39:16,406 --> 00:39:18,397
What about you, Doctor?

463
00:39:18,566 --> 00:39:21,080
What the hell are you changing into?

464
00:39:25,606 --> 00:39:27,722
I couldn't...

465
00:39:31,446 --> 00:39:33,084
I wasn't...

466
00:39:38,766 --> 00:39:42,395
Oh, Rose. They're all dead.

467
00:39:42,566 --> 00:39:47,686
(DALEK) Why do we survive?

468
00:39:48,726 --> 00:39:50,079
I don't know.

469
00:39:50,246 --> 00:39:57,277
I am the last of the Daleks.

470
00:39:58,446 --> 00:40:00,437
You're not even that.

471
00:40:01,406 --> 00:40:03,522
Rose did more than regenerate you.

472
00:40:04,446 --> 00:40:06,641
You've absorbed her DNA.

473
00:40:06,806 --> 00:40:08,239
You're mutating.

474
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:11,842
Into what?

475
00:40:12,006 --> 00:40:14,122
Something new.

476
00:40:17,086 --> 00:40:18,405
I'm sorry.

477
00:40:18,566 --> 00:40:20,363
Isn't that better?

478
00:40:20,526 --> 00:40:22,721
Not for a Dalek.

479
00:40:23,966 --> 00:40:27,436
(DALEK) I can feel.

480
00:40:28,406 --> 00:40:31,716
So many ideas.

481
00:40:31,886 --> 00:40:36,323
So much darkness.

482
00:40:36,486 --> 00:40:40,365
Rose, give me orders.

483
00:40:41,726 --> 00:40:46,163
Order me to die.

484
00:40:49,566 --> 00:40:51,079
I can't do that.

485
00:40:51,246 --> 00:40:54,602
(DALEK) This is not life.

486
00:40:54,766 --> 00:40:57,758
This is sickness.

487
00:40:57,926 --> 00:41:02,238
I shall not be like you.

488
00:41:02,406 --> 00:41:05,000
Order my destruction!

489
00:41:06,406 --> 00:41:09,398
Obey! Obey!

490
00:41:09,566 --> 00:41:11,955
Obey!

491
00:41:13,726 --> 00:41:15,717
Do it.

492
00:41:17,286 --> 00:41:23,964
Are you frightened, Rose Tyler?

493
00:41:26,686 --> 00:41:28,642
Yeah.

494
00:41:28,806 --> 00:41:31,718
So am I.

495
00:41:33,286 --> 00:41:37,962
Exterminate.

496
00:42:11,046 --> 00:42:15,437
- What the hell are you doing?
- 200 personnel dead because of you, sir.

497
00:42:16,286 --> 00:42:19,483
Wipe his memory
and leave him by the road someplace.

498
00:42:19,646 --> 00:42:22,206
You can't do this. I am Henry Van Statten!

499
00:42:22,366 --> 00:42:25,802
By tonight, you'll be a homeless, brainless junkie

500
00:42:25,966 --> 00:42:29,515
living on the streets
of San Diego, Seattle, Sacramento.

501
00:42:29,686 --> 00:42:32,962
Someplace beginning with S.

502
00:42:36,326 --> 00:42:39,363
(DOCTOR) A piece of home. Better than nothing.

503
00:42:39,526 --> 00:42:43,280
- Is that the end of it, the Time War?
- I'm the only one left.

504
00:42:43,446 --> 00:42:46,438
I win. How about that (?)

505
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:50,155
The Dalek survived.
Maybe some of your people did, too.

506
00:42:50,326 --> 00:42:52,999
I know. In here.

507
00:42:54,126 --> 00:42:56,594
- Feels like there's no one.
- Well, then.

508
00:42:56,766 --> 00:42:59,963
- Good thing I'm not going anywhere.
- Yeah.

509
00:43:00,126 --> 00:43:06,884
We'd better get out. Van Statten's disappeared.
Goddard says they're filling this with cement.

510
00:43:07,046 --> 00:43:10,163
- About time!
- I'll have to go back home.

511
00:43:10,326 --> 00:43:11,725
You'd better hurry up.

512
00:43:11,886 --> 00:43:16,676
- Next flight to Heathrow is at 1500.
- Adam said that he wanted to see the stars.

513
00:43:16,846 --> 00:43:18,882
Tell him to stand outside, then.

514
00:43:19,046 --> 00:43:21,685
He's all on his own, and he DID help.

515
00:43:21,846 --> 00:43:23,882
- He left you there.
- So did you.

516
00:43:24,046 --> 00:43:27,277
- We've got to leave!
- Plus, he's a bit pretty.

517
00:43:27,446 --> 00:43:28,765
I hadn't noticed.

518
00:43:30,366 --> 00:43:33,244
- On your own head.
- (ADAM) What are you doing?

519
00:43:33,406 --> 00:43:37,922
She said cement! She wasn't joking.
We're going to get sealed in!

520
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:42,756
Doctor? What are you doing
standing inside a box?

521
00:43:42,926 --> 00:43:44,996
(TARDIS ROARS INTO LIFE)

522
00:43:46,126 --> 00:43:47,764
Rose?

523
00:43:49,846 --> 00:43:52,838
(WHOOSHING)

524
00:44:00,646 --> 00:44:05,083
The fourth great and bountiful human empire -
Planet Earth at its height.

525
00:44:06,966 --> 00:44:09,480
Kronkburger - one cheese, one pajatos.

526
00:44:09,646 --> 00:44:11,204
Something's wrong.

527
00:44:11,806 --> 00:44:15,879
- My watch must be wrong.
- Your history's not as good as you thought.

528
00:44:16,046 --> 00:44:18,082
- It's perfect.
- Obviously not.

529
00:44:18,246 --> 00:44:19,725
I can taste it.

530
00:44:19,886 --> 00:44:21,205
Engage safety.

531
00:44:21,366 --> 00:44:23,880
<i>(MAN) Someone shouldn't be here.</i>

532
00:44:26,806 --> 00:44:29,161
- Who are you?
- I'm the Editor.

533
00:44:29,326 --> 00:44:30,805
What's happening?

534
00:44:30,966 --> 00:44:32,558
(WOMAN) And spike.

535
00:44:35,166 --> 00:44:36,519
Agh!
