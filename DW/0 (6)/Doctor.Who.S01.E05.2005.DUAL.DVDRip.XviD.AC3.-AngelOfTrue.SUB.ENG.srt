- I'm serious. We could.

do need a release code, but it's kept by the UN.

- What DO they want?

188

They're just one family, so it's not an invasion.

00:25:23,094 --> 00:25:25,528
(THEY LAUGH)

332
00:25:25,694 --> 00:25:27,173
What?

333
00:25:27,334 --> 00:25:28,733
You?

334
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:30,612
Trapped in your box?

335
00:25:32,094 --> 00:25:35,052
Yes. Me.

336
00:25:37,094 --> 00:25:39,085
(SHE LAUGHS)

337
00:25:56,014 --> 00:26:00,166
Yesterday saw the start of a brave new world.

338
00:26:00,334 --> 00:26:03,167
Today might see it end.

339
00:26:03,334 --> 00:26:05,325
The streets are deserted.

340
00:26:05,494 --> 00:26:08,850
Everyone's home, just waiting

341
00:26:09,014 --> 00:26:12,131
as the future is decided in New York.

342
00:26:16,334 --> 00:26:20,532
<i>(W0MAN) It's midnight in New York.</i>
<i>The United Nations has gathered.</i>

343
00:26:20,694 --> 00:26:26,451
<i>England has provided them with proof that</i>
<i>the massive weapons of destruction do exist.</i>

344
00:26:26,614 --> 00:26:31,244
<i>The Security Council will be making a resolution</i>
<i>in a matter of minutes,</i>

345
00:26:31,414 --> 00:26:33,484
<i>and once the codes are released,</i>

346
00:26:33,654 --> 00:26:37,203
<i>humanity's first interplanetary war begins.</i>

347
00:26:47,694 --> 00:26:49,013
Sergeant...

348
00:26:49,694 --> 00:26:53,209
We'll take the call
in the prime minister's office.

349
00:26:53,374 --> 00:26:55,604
Maintain your positions.

350
00:26:55,774 --> 00:26:58,288
Good luck.

351
00:27:06,854 --> 00:27:10,130
Look at that! The telephone is actually red!

352
00:27:10,294 --> 00:27:13,047
- (SHE GIGGLES)
- (PHRRT!) Oh!

353
00:27:14,134 --> 00:27:17,763
- How long till they phone?
- Counting down...

354
00:27:19,814 --> 00:27:23,887
I'm not saying I trust you,
but there must be something you can do.

355
00:27:24,054 --> 00:27:26,966
If we fermented the port,
we'd make acetic acid.

356
00:27:27,134 --> 00:27:28,487
Mickey, any luck?

357
00:27:28,654 --> 00:27:32,886
- <i>Everyone's on voicemail.</i>
- Voicemail dooms us all.

358
00:27:33,054 --> 00:27:35,693
- We have to get out of here.
- There is a way.

359
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:38,926
- What?
- There's always been a way out.

360
00:27:39,094 --> 00:27:44,407
- Then why don't we use it?
- Because I can't guarantee Rose's safety.

361
00:27:44,574 --> 00:27:47,486
Don't you dare! Whatever it is, don't you dare!

362
00:27:47,654 --> 00:27:49,929
If I don't dare, everyone dies.

363
00:27:50,094 --> 00:27:52,164
Do it.

364
00:27:53,894 --> 00:27:56,931
You don't even know what it is.
You'd just let me?

365
00:27:57,094 --> 00:27:58,413
Yeah.

366
00:28:01,414 --> 00:28:04,565
Please. She's my daughter. She's just a kid.

367
00:28:04,734 --> 00:28:08,807
Do you think I don't know that?
This is my life. It's not fun or smart.

368
00:28:08,974 --> 00:28:13,172
It's standing up and making a decision
because nobody else will.

369
00:28:13,334 --> 00:28:16,132
Then what are you waiting for?

370
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:19,172
I could save the world but lose you.

371
00:28:27,374 --> 00:28:30,172
Except it's not your decision, Doctor.

372
00:28:31,094 --> 00:28:33,688
- It's mine.
- And who the hell are you?

373
00:28:33,854 --> 00:28:36,243
Harriet Jones, MP for Flydale North.

374
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:41,932
The only elected representative in this room,
chosen by the people for the people.

375
00:28:42,094 --> 00:28:45,291
On behalf of the people, I command you...do it.

376
00:28:48,254 --> 00:28:53,203
Victory...should be naked!

377
00:28:55,894 --> 00:28:57,725
(BUZZING)

378
00:29:02,254 --> 00:29:05,883
- How do we get out?
- We don't. We stay here.

379
00:29:09,454 --> 00:29:13,572
The Council is voting. The results
should be known any second now.

380
00:29:21,334 --> 00:29:24,963
Use the ''Buffalo'' password.
It overrides everything.

381
00:29:25,134 --> 00:29:26,647
What are you doing?

382
00:29:27,534 --> 00:29:33,291
Hacking into the Royal Navy. We're in. Here
it is - HMS Taurean, Trafalgar Class submarine,

383
00:29:33,454 --> 00:29:35,649
ten miles off the coast of Plymouth.

384
00:29:35,814 --> 00:29:40,410
- <i>(D0CT0R) Select a missile.</i>
- We can't go nuclear. We don't have the codes.

385
00:29:40,574 --> 00:29:44,453
All we need is an ordinary missile.
What's the first category?

386
00:29:44,614 --> 00:29:48,448
- Sub Harpoon, UGM-84A.
- That's the one. Select.

387
00:29:49,694 --> 00:29:51,491
I could stop you.

388
00:29:54,254 --> 00:29:57,132
- Do it, then.
- <i>(D0CT0R) Are you ready for this?</i>

389
00:29:59,814 --> 00:30:01,770
Yeah.

390
00:30:05,294 --> 00:30:08,525
Mickey the idiot, the world is in your hands.

391
00:30:09,414 --> 00:30:10,733
<i>Fire.</i>

392
00:30:19,534 --> 00:30:22,048
Oh, my God!

393
00:30:27,934 --> 00:30:30,402
(BEEPING)

394
00:30:32,654 --> 00:30:34,485
How solid are these?

395
00:30:34,654 --> 00:30:38,852
Not solid enough.
Built for short-range attack. Nothing this big.

396
00:30:39,014 --> 00:30:41,972
Now I'M making the decision. I'm not gonna die.

397
00:30:42,134 --> 00:30:47,766
We're gonna ride this one out. You can survive
earthquakes by standing under a door frame.

398
00:30:47,934 --> 00:30:51,927
This cupboard's small, so it's strong.
Come and help me.

399
00:30:57,574 --> 00:30:59,565
The vote is in.

400
00:30:59,734 --> 00:31:01,725
The Council says...

401
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:07,048
Yes. They are releasing the codes.

402
00:31:08,174 --> 00:31:10,051
Ring, damn you!

403
00:31:10,214 --> 00:31:14,093
- (BEEPING)
- It's on radar. Counter the defence 556.

404
00:31:14,254 --> 00:31:17,246
- Stop them intercepting it.
- I'm doing it now.

405
00:31:20,414 --> 00:31:23,167
<i>(MICKEY) 556 neutralised.</i>

406
00:31:28,174 --> 00:31:30,734
What do you mean, incoming?

407
00:31:40,574 --> 00:31:43,805
- (ALARM)
- Everybody out! Now!

408
00:31:45,734 --> 00:31:48,407
- (ALARM)
- What the hell is that for?

409
00:31:49,094 --> 00:31:51,449
Sir, there's a missile...

410
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:54,246
Sorry.

411
00:32:08,614 --> 00:32:12,209
- That's mine! You've got mine!
- Disguise me!

412
00:32:12,374 --> 00:32:15,366
You're the blonde. I want the other one.

413
00:32:15,534 --> 00:32:16,967
Take it off!

414
00:32:20,094 --> 00:32:21,732
Everybody run!

415
00:32:30,854 --> 00:32:32,446
Here we go.

416
00:32:32,614 --> 00:32:35,845
Nice knowing you both.

417
00:32:36,014 --> 00:32:37,333
Hannibal!

418
00:32:38,694 --> 00:32:41,162
Oh, boll...

(HARRIET) Made in Britain!

420
00:33:17,294 --> 00:33:20,650
- Are you all right?
- Harriet Jones. MP Flydale North.

421
00:33:20,814 --> 00:33:25,683
Contact the UN. Tell the ambassadors
the crisis is over. They can step down.

422
00:33:25,854 --> 00:33:31,167
Go on. Tell the news. Someone's got
a hell of a job sorting this lot out!

423
00:33:31,334 --> 00:33:35,373
- We haven't even got a prime minister!
- Maybe you should have a go.

424
00:33:35,534 --> 00:33:37,684
Me? I'm only a backbencher.

425
00:33:37,854 --> 00:33:40,732
- I'd vote for you.
- Now, don't be silly.

426
00:33:42,174 --> 00:33:45,723
I'd better go and see if I can help. Hang on!

427
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:50,491
(HARRIET) We're safe!

428
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:53,612
The Earth is safe!

429
00:33:53,774 --> 00:33:56,049
- (SIREN)
- Sergeant!

430
00:33:56,214 --> 00:33:58,330
I thought I knew the name.

431
00:33:59,214 --> 00:34:00,613
Harriet Jones.

432
00:34:00,774 --> 00:34:04,687
Future prime minister.
Elected for three successive terms.

433
00:34:04,854 --> 00:34:10,406
- The architect of Britain's Golden Age.
- (HARRIET) The crisis has passed!

434
00:34:10,574 --> 00:34:16,206
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have something to say to you all here today.

435
00:34:18,854 --> 00:34:25,089
Mankind stands tall, proud and undefeated.

436
00:34:25,254 --> 00:34:28,326
God bless the human race!

00:34:51,334 --> 00:34:54,565

<i>(HARRIET 0N TV) Mankind stands tall...</i>

439
00:34:59,614 --> 00:35:02,811
(MUM) Harriet Jones!
Who does she think she is?

440
00:35:02,974 --> 00:35:08,685
Look at her taking all the credit. It should be you
on there. My daughter saved the world!

441
00:35:08,854 --> 00:35:10,845
I think the Doctor helped a bit.

442
00:35:11,014 --> 00:35:13,767
All right, then. Him too.

443
00:35:13,934 --> 00:35:18,246
- You should be given knighthoods.
- It's not the way he does things.

444
00:35:18,414 --> 00:35:22,612
No fuss. He just moves on.
He's not that bad if you gave him a chance.

445
00:35:22,774 --> 00:35:25,334
He's good in a crisis, I'll give him that.

446
00:35:25,494 --> 00:35:29,203
Oh, now the world HAS changed -
you're being nice about him!

447
00:35:29,374 --> 00:35:33,128
I've got no choice. I can't get rid of him.
You're infatuated.

448
00:35:33,294 --> 00:35:34,932
I'm not infatuated.

449
00:35:35,094 --> 00:35:37,767
- What does he eat?
- How do you mean?

450
00:35:37,934 --> 00:35:43,088
I was going to do shepherd's pie.
All of us. A proper sit-down...

451
00:35:43,254 --> 00:35:45,848
..'cause...I'm ready to listen.

452
00:35:46,014 --> 00:35:49,643
I want to learn about you and him
and that life you lead.

453
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:55,366
He's an alien. For all I know,
he eats grass and safety pins and things.

454
00:35:55,534 --> 00:35:59,004
He'll have shepherd's pie.
You're gonna cook for him?

455
00:35:59,174 --> 00:36:03,008
- What's wrong with that?
- He's finally met his match.

456
00:36:03,174 --> 00:36:06,291
You're not too old for a slap, you know!

457
00:36:07,494 --> 00:36:10,725
- You can visit your gran tomorrow.
- (PHONE RINGS)

458
00:36:10,894 --> 00:36:14,170
I told her you were in France.
Said you were au-pairing.

459
00:36:16,814 --> 00:36:18,133
Hello?

460
00:36:18,294 --> 00:36:21,570
- Right. Two hours, then we can go.
- You've got a phone?

461
00:36:21,734 --> 00:36:25,886
You think I can travel through time
and I haven't got a phone? Huh!

462
00:36:26,054 --> 00:36:30,491
I've just got to send out this dispersal.
There you go.

463
00:36:30,654 --> 00:36:35,170
That cancels out the Slitheen advert
in case any bargain hunters turn up.

464
00:36:35,334 --> 00:36:37,086
My mother's cooking.

465

- Put her on a slow heat and let her simmer.
- <i>She's cooking tea.</i>

466
00:36:41,174 --> 00:36:43,927
- I don't do that.
- She wants to get to know you.

467
00:36:44,094 --> 00:36:46,449
- I'm busy.
- It's just tea.

468
00:36:46,614 --> 00:36:48,047
Not to me, it isn't.

469
00:36:48,214 --> 00:36:50,444
- She's my mother.
- She's not mine.

470
00:36:50,614 --> 00:36:53,686
- That's not fair.
- You can stay there if you want.

471
00:36:55,174 --> 00:36:58,371
A plasma storm's brewing
in the Horsehead Nebula.

472
00:36:58,534 --> 00:37:01,207
Fires are burning ten million miles wide.

473
00:37:01,374 --> 00:37:06,004
I could fly the Tardis right into it
and ride the shock wave all the way out.

474
00:37:06,174 --> 00:37:10,213
Hurtle right across the sky
and end up anywhere.

00:37:11,974 --> 00:37:13,965
Your choice.

00:37:25,774 --> 00:37:28,925
(MUM) Rose, I was thinking...

477
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:33,687
I've got that bottle of Amaretto
from New Year's Eve. Does he drink?

478
00:37:38,174 --> 00:37:41,883
- I was wondering whether he drinks or not.
- Yeah, he does.

479
00:37:47,094 --> 00:37:48,925
Don't go, sweetheart.

480
00:37:50,294 --> 00:37:52,762
Please don't go.

481
00:38:08,014 --> 00:38:11,768
Good lad. Graffiti that again and I'll have you.
Now, beat it!

482
00:38:17,934 --> 00:38:23,930
I just went down the shop and I was thinking,
''The whole world's changed.''

483
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:26,767
Aliens and spaceships, all in public.

484
00:38:27,934 --> 00:38:29,253
And here it is.

485
00:38:30,214 --> 00:38:32,728
How could they do that? They saw it.

486
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:35,886
You're happy to believe in something invisible,

487
00:38:36,054 --> 00:38:39,171
but if it's staring you in the face,
you can't see it.

488
00:38:39,334 --> 00:38:42,963
There's a scientific explanation for that -
you're thick.

489
00:38:43,134 --> 00:38:44,453
We're just idiots.

490
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:47,447
- Well, not all of you.
- Yeah?

491
00:38:48,734 --> 00:38:52,773
That's a virus. Put it online.
It'll destroy every mention of me.

492
00:38:52,934 --> 00:38:56,165
- I'll cease to exist.
- What do you want to do that for?

493
00:38:56,334 --> 00:39:00,486
You're right, I am dangerous.
I don't want anybody following me.

494
00:39:00,654 --> 00:39:07,002
- How can you say that, then take her with you?
- You could look after her. Come with us.

495
00:39:07,174 --> 00:39:09,165
I can't.

496
00:39:09,334 --> 00:39:14,010
This life of yours, it's just too much.
I couldn't do it.

497
00:39:15,814 --> 00:39:17,486
Don't tell her I said that.

498
00:39:17,654 --> 00:39:23,604
I'll get a job. I'll work weekends. I'll pass
my test. If Jim comes round again, I'll say no.

499
00:39:23,774 --> 00:39:27,244
I'm not leaving 'cause of you.
I'm just travelling.

500
00:39:27,414 --> 00:39:31,407
- But it's not safe.
- Mum, if you saw it out there,

501
00:39:31,574 --> 00:39:33,883
you'd never stay home.

502
00:39:35,014 --> 00:39:36,333
Got enough stuff (?)

503
00:39:36,494 --> 00:39:41,363
The first time I stepped in there,
it was spur-of-the-moment. Now I'm signing up.

504
00:39:41,534 --> 00:39:44,412
You're stuck with me. Hah!

505
00:39:46,014 --> 00:39:49,131
- Come with us. There's room.
- (DOCTOR) No chance.

506
00:39:49,294 --> 00:39:52,650
- He's a liability.
- We'd be dead without him.

507
00:39:52,814 --> 00:39:54,247
My decision is final.

508
00:39:56,294 --> 00:39:57,613
Sorry.

509
00:40:01,054 --> 00:40:02,373
Good luck.

510
00:40:02,534 --> 00:40:05,810
You still can't promise me.
What if she gets lost?

511
00:40:05,974 --> 00:40:11,526
What if something happens to you and she's
left on some moon a million light years away?

512
00:40:11,694 --> 00:40:14,254
- How long do I wait then?
- Mum...

513
00:40:14,414 --> 00:40:16,325
It's a time machine.

514
00:40:16,494 --> 00:40:21,887
I could travel around suns and planets
and all the way out to the edge of the universe,

515
00:40:22,054 --> 00:40:26,332
and by the time I get back, ten seconds
would have passed. Ten seconds.

516
00:40:26,494 --> 00:40:28,849
So stop worrying.

517
00:40:29,014 --> 00:40:32,404
See you in ten seconds' time, yeah?

518
00:40:54,014 --> 00:40:56,926
(WHOOSHING)

519
00:41:14,454 --> 00:41:16,365
Ten seconds.

520
00:41:36,574 --> 00:41:40,249
(ROSE) It's a great big museum.
(DOCTOR) An alien museum.

521
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:45,090
- It's my one living specimen.
- It fell through time. The only survivor.

522
00:41:45,254 --> 00:41:49,452
- Do something!
- I swear, no one on this base is safe.

523
00:41:49,614 --> 00:41:52,845
- You've got to keep it in that cell.
- It can't get out.

524
00:41:54,214 --> 00:41:55,886
Civilians. Let 'em through.

525
00:41:56,214 --> 00:41:59,411
It will kill all of us! What's the nearest town?

526
00:41:59,574 --> 00:42:04,011
- Salt Lake City. Population one million.
- All dead. Follow this order.

527
00:42:04,174 --> 00:42:07,086
- Just die!
- Nearly there. Give us two seconds.

528
00:42:07,254 --> 00:42:10,803
- I've come to help. I'm the Doctor.
- Exterminate!

529
00:42:10,974 --> 00:42:12,532
- Impossible!
- Exterminate!
