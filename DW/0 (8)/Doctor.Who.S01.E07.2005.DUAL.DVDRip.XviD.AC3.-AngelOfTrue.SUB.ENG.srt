00:25:43,047 --> 00:25:47,359
Exactly. I give up on you, Cathica.
Now, Rose asked the right question.

330
00:25:47,527 --> 00:25:49,438
- I thank you.
- Why is it so hot?

331

- Why worry about the central heating?
- Never underestimate plumbing.

332

Satellite Five - pipes and plumbing.
Look at the layout.

347

This is ridiculous.
You've got access to the computer's core.

348
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:54,445
You could look at the archive, the stock
exchange...and you're looking at pipes?

349

- I suppose...
- Why, what is it?

351
00:26:59,847 --> 00:27:04,557
The ventilation system. Cooling ducts,
ice filters, all working flat out,

352
00:27:04,727 --> 00:27:08,515
- channelling massive amounts of heat down.
- From the top.

353

- (ROSE) Floor 500.
- Something is generating tons of heat.

354

It's all going on upstairs. Fancy a trip?

with ''Oh, Danny Boy''.

Create a climate of fear
and it's easy to keep the borders closed.

It's just a matter of emphasis. The right word
in the right broadcast repeated often enough

So all the people on Earth are like slaves?

422

Well, now, there's an interesting point.

00:32:54,167 --> 00:32:58,001
Is a slave a slave
if he doesn't know he's enslaved?

- Oh! I was hoping for a philosophical debate.

From time to time, yes, but the computer chip

when they're not - they're just cattle.

- Jagrafess.

- Simply being human doesn't pay very well.

Terminate her access!

492
00:38:04,687 --> 00:38:09,283
Everything I told her about the pipes,
the filters - she's reversing it.

493
00:38:09,447 --> 00:38:11,517
Look at that! It's getting hot.

494
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:15,158
I said terminate her!

495
00:38:17,367 --> 00:38:19,437
Burn out her mind!

496
00:38:20,567 --> 00:38:24,924
Oh, no, you don't.
You should have promoted me years back!

497
00:38:29,447 --> 00:38:32,007
(SCREAMING)

498
00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:55,037
She's venting the heat up here. The Jagrafess
has to stay cool - now it's on top of a volcano!

(PEOPLE SCREAM)

- (SNARLING PROTEST)
- Yes, I'm trying, sir, but...

501
00:39:02,167 --> 00:39:06,558
It's impossible -
a member of staff with an idea!

502
00:39:09,167 --> 00:39:11,476
(SHRIEKS)

503
00:39:14,287 --> 00:39:16,517
- What do I do?
- Flick the switch!

507
00:39:32,847 --> 00:39:35,122
Oi! Do you want to bank on a certainty?

508
00:39:35,287 --> 00:39:38,802
Massive heat in a massive body -
massive bang!

509
00:39:38,967 --> 00:39:40,958
See you in the headlines!

510
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:45,156
(BELLOWS)

511
00:39:46,247 --> 00:39:49,557
If it's all the same to you,
I think I'll resign. Bye.

512
00:39:52,567 --> 00:39:53,886
Let go of me!

Let go of me!

516
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:13,243
Agh!

517
00:40:13,527 --> 00:40:14,846
(BANG!)

518
00:40:29,367 --> 00:40:32,598
We're gonna go. Too many questions.
You'll manage.

519
00:40:32,767 --> 00:40:36,840
- No one will believe me.
- They might believe a lot of things now.

520
00:40:37,007 --> 00:40:40,522
- Humans will get back to normal.
- What about your friend?

521
00:40:40,687 --> 00:40:43,042
He's not my friend.

522
00:40:44,447 --> 00:40:47,803
- Now, don't...
- (ADAM) I'm all right now.

523
00:40:47,967 --> 00:40:50,003
Much better. And I've got the key.

524
00:40:50,167 --> 00:40:51,725
Look, it's...

525
00:40:52,607 --> 00:40:55,440
It all worked out for the best, didn't it?

526
00:40:56,647 --> 00:41:01,357
You know, it's not actually my fault
because you were in charge...

527
00:41:03,487 --> 00:41:05,478
This is my house! I'm home.

528
00:41:05,647 --> 00:41:11,005
Oh, my God, I'm home! Blimey! I thought
you were going to chuck me out of an airlock.

529
00:41:11,167 --> 00:41:15,240
- Is there something else you want to tell me?
- No. What do you mean?

530
00:41:16,887 --> 00:41:22,245
The archive of Satellite Five. One second
of that message could have changed the world.

531
00:41:29,367 --> 00:41:32,803
- That's it, then. See you.
- How do you mean, see you?

532
00:41:32,967 --> 00:41:36,516
- As in goodbye.
- What about me? You can't just go.

533
00:41:36,687 --> 00:41:39,645
- I have a chip type two. My head opens.
- Like this?

534
00:41:40,967 --> 00:41:43,561
- Don't.
- Don't do what?

535
00:41:44,887 --> 00:41:46,923
Stop it!

536
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:49,317
All right, that's enough. Stop it.

537
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:53,480
Thank you.

538
00:41:53,647 --> 00:41:55,717
- Oi!
- Sorry. I couldn't resist.

539
00:41:55,887 --> 00:41:59,926
- History could have changed because of you.
- I just wanted to help.

540
00:42:00,087 --> 00:42:03,636
- You were helping yourself.
- I said I'm sorry, and I am.

541
00:42:03,807 --> 00:42:05,957
You can't just leave me like this.

542
00:42:06,127 --> 00:42:11,599
If anyone sees that head, they'll dissect you
in seconds. You'll have to lead a quiet life.

543
00:42:11,767 --> 00:42:14,042
Be average. Unseen. Good luck.

544
00:42:14,207 --> 00:42:16,437
But I want to come with you.

545
00:42:16,607 --> 00:42:19,997
I only take the best. I've got Rose.

546
00:42:20,647 --> 00:42:22,080
(ADAM) Rose!

547
00:42:22,247 --> 00:42:26,126
- Oh, my God!
- (MUM) Who's that? Geoff, is that you?

548
00:42:26,287 --> 00:42:30,121
- It's me, Mum. Don't come in. Wait there.
- Oh, my Lord!

549
00:42:30,287 --> 00:42:32,482
You never said you were coming home!

550
00:42:33,487 --> 00:42:36,081
(MUM) Hold on. I'll just take my coat off.

551
00:42:36,247 --> 00:42:38,203
Rose, take me with you.

552
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:44,042
- (WHOOSHING)
- What's that noise?

553
00:42:44,207 --> 00:42:48,041
Have you left the back door open?
Blimey, there's a draught!

554
00:42:48,207 --> 00:42:52,041
What a surprise! Let me look at you!

555
00:42:52,207 --> 00:42:54,277
Six months!

556
00:42:54,447 --> 00:42:58,725
It's like I saw you yesterday.
Time goes by like that.

Be careful what you wish for.

559
00:43:07,607 --> 00:43:11,805
The day my father died. It's just an ordinary day.

560
00:43:11,967 --> 00:43:15,198
Oh, God, this is it. He can't die on his own!

561
00:43:16,367 --> 00:43:18,722
(ROSE) Can I try again?

562
00:43:19,687 --> 00:43:22,155
- Oh, God, this is it.
- Rose, no!

563
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:27,882
- I chose another stupid ape!
- I haven't changed history.

564
00:43:28,047 --> 00:43:33,326
A man is alive who wasn't alive before.
The world's different because he's alive.

565
00:43:35,727 --> 00:43:39,322
Time's been damaged.
They've come to sterilise the wound.

- Get in the church!
- Agh!
