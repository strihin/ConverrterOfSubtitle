This isn't just a game.

There's something else going on.

4
00:00:10,567 --> 00:00:13,798
-We have contestants outside of the games.
-The games continue.

I saw you die!

-Obviously they survived.

<i>We have your associate.</i>

<i>You know the Doctor. You understand him.</i>

<i>-You will predict his actions.</i>
-I don't know!

<i>-Launch missiles! Exterminate!</i>

You're gonna kill him.

<i>You have predicted correctly.</i>

We've got incoming!

00:01:53,327 --> 00:01:56,842
The extrapolator's working.
We've got a fully functional force-field.

-Yeah. And you?
-Not bad. Been better.

-Don't I get a hug?
-Oh, come here.

34
00:02:51,407 --> 00:02:54,001
I was talking to him. Welcome home.

35
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:58,923
-Oh! I thought I'd never see you again.
-You were lucky, that was just a one-shot wonder.

00:02:59,007 --> 00:03:01,919
Drained the gun of all its power supply.
Now it's just a piece of junk.

<i>Patience, my brethren.</i>

38
00:03:06,927 --> 00:03:09,236
(ROSE) You said they were extinct.
How come they're still alive?

39
00:03:09,327 --> 00:03:11,318
One minute
they're the greatest threat in the universe,

40
00:03:11,407 --> 00:03:13,477
the next minute
they vanished out of time and space.

41
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:15,523
They went off to fight a bigger war.

42
00:03:17,087 --> 00:03:18,600
The Time War.

43
00:03:18,687 --> 00:03:21,918
-I thought that was just a legend.
-I was there.

44
00:03:22,007 --> 00:03:26,080
The war between the Daleks and the Time Lords,
with the whole of creation at stake.

45
00:03:26,327 --> 00:03:29,239
My people were destroyed
but they took the Daleks with them.

46
00:03:30,047 --> 00:03:31,844
I almost thought it was worth it.

47
00:03:32,607 --> 00:03:34,723
And now it turns out they died for nothing.

48
00:03:35,407 --> 00:03:38,797
There's thousands of them now.
We could hardly stop one.

49
00:03:39,807 --> 00:03:41,479
What are we gonna do?

50
00:03:41,927 --> 00:03:45,522
No good stood round here chinwagging.
Human race, you'd gossip all day.

51
00:03:46,007 --> 00:03:49,363
The Daleks have got the answers.
Let's go and meet the neighbours.

52
00:03:49,487 --> 00:03:50,363

That force-field can hold back anything.

56

Almost anything.

00:04:08,007 --> 00:04:11,283
-Yes, but I wasn't going to tell them that. Thanks.
-Sorry.

58
00:04:15,087 --> 00:04:18,796
Do you know what they call me
in the ancient legends of the Dalek homeworld?

59
00:04:18,927 --> 00:04:20,485
The Oncoming Storm.

60
00:04:21,847 --> 00:04:26,318
You might have removed all your emotions,
but I reckon right down deep in your DNA,

61
00:04:26,407 --> 00:04:30,639
there's one little spark left. And that's fear.

62
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:35,880
Doesn't it just burn when you face me?

63
00:04:37,287 --> 00:04:41,041
So tell me, how did you survive the Time War?

64
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:44,444
<i>They survived through me.</i>

65
00:04:58,687 --> 00:05:01,042
Rose. Captain.

66
00:05:02,527 --> 00:05:04,563
This is the Emperor of the Daleks.

<i>You destroyed us, Doctor.</i>

68
00:05:07,927 --> 00:05:11,283
<i>The Dalek race died In your Inferno.</i>

69
00:05:11,367 --> 00:05:15,758
<i>But my ship survived, falling through time,</i>

70
00:05:15,847 --> 00:05:18,520
<i>crippled but alive.</i>

71
00:05:18,607 --> 00:05:20,723
-I get it....
<i>-Do not Interrupt!</i>

00:05:20,807 --> 00:05:24,163
<i>-Do not Interrupt!</i>
<i>-Do not Interrupt!</i>

00:05:24,247 --> 00:05:26,238
I think you're forgetting something.

74
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:29,205
I'm the Doctor
and if there's one thing I can do, it's talk.

75
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:32,802
I've got five billion languages
and you haven't got one way of stopping me.

76
00:05:32,887 --> 00:05:35,401
So if anybody's gonna shut up, it's you!

77
00:05:37,247 --> 00:05:39,283
Okie-doke. So, where were we?

78
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:43,959
<i>We waited here, In the dark space,</i>

79
00:05:44,047 --> 00:05:47,039
<i>damaged but rebuilding.</i>

80
00:05:47,687 --> 00:05:49,518
<i>Centuries passed</i>

81
00:05:49,607 --> 00:05:54,442
<i>and we quietly Infiltrated the systems of Earth,</i>

82
00:05:54,527 --> 00:05:57,678
<i>harvesting the waste of humanity.</i>

83
00:05:58,007 --> 00:06:00,396
<i>The prisoners, the refugees,</i>

84
00:06:00,487 --> 00:06:04,116
<i>the dispossessed, they all came to us.</i>

85
00:06:04,207 --> 00:06:08,280
<i>The bodies were filleted, pulped, sifted.</i>

86
00:06:08,807 --> 00:06:11,640
<i>The seed of the human race Is perverted.</i>

87
00:06:11,727 --> 00:06:16,118
<i>0nly one cell In a billion was fit to be nurtured.</i>

88
00:06:16,407 --> 00:06:19,683
So you created an army of Daleks out of the dead.

89
00:06:19,767 --> 00:06:22,759
That makes them half human.

90
00:06:22,847 --> 00:06:25,998
<i>Those words are blasphemy!</i>

91
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:29,921
<i>-Do not blaspheme!</i>
<i>-Do not blaspheme!</i>

92
00:06:30,007 --> 00:06:31,759
<i>Do not blaspheme!</i>

93
00:06:31,847 --> 00:06:35,601
<i>Everything human has been purged.</i>

<i>I cultivated</i>

95
00:06:37,607 --> 00:06:40,963
<i>pure and blessed Dalek.</i>

96
00:06:44,687 --> 00:06:47,599
Since when did the Daleks
have a concept of blasphemy?

97
00:06:47,687 --> 00:06:52,397
<i>I reached Into the dirt and made new life.</i>

98
00:06:52,487 --> 00:06:56,605
<i>I am the God of all Daleks!</i>

99
00:06:56,687 --> 00:06:58,996
<i>-Worship him!</i>
<i>-Worship him!</i>

100
00:06:59,087 --> 00:07:00,361
<i>Worship him!</i>

101
00:07:00,847 --> 00:07:02,326
They're insane.

102
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:07,240
Hiding in silence for hundreds of years,
that's enough to drive anyone mad.

103
00:07:07,767 --> 00:07:09,485
But it's worse than that.

104
00:07:10,527 --> 00:07:12,961
Driven mad by your own flesh.

105
00:07:14,927 --> 00:07:17,157
The stink of humanity.

106
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:23,037
You hate your own existence.

107
00:07:25,527 --> 00:07:29,042
And that makes them more deadly than ever.

108
00:07:29,727 --> 00:07:34,005
-We're going.
<i>-You may not leave my presence!</i>

(WHOOSHING)

115
00:08:00,607 --> 00:08:04,725
Turn everything up! All transmitters,
full power, wide open, now! Do it!

116
00:08:04,807 --> 00:08:07,275
-What does this do?
-Stops the Daleks from transmitting on board.

117
00:08:07,367 --> 00:08:08,766
How did you get on? Did you contact Earth?

118
00:08:08,847 --> 00:08:13,045
I tried to warn them, but all they did was suspend
our licence 'cause we stopped the programmes.

119
00:08:13,127 --> 00:08:15,721
And the planet's just sitting there. Defenceless.

120
00:08:15,887 --> 00:08:19,800
Lynda, what are you still doing on board?
I told you to evacuate everyone!

121
00:08:19,887 --> 00:08:22,082
-She wouldn't go.
-I didn't wanna leave you.

122
00:08:23,687 --> 00:08:26,121
There weren't enough shuttles anyway
or I wouldn't be here.

123
00:08:26,207 --> 00:08:28,357
We've got about 1 00 people
stranded on Floor Zero.

124
00:08:28,607 --> 00:08:32,646
Listen, my name's Rodrick.
I won the game, where's my money?

125
00:08:32,727 --> 00:08:35,719
<i>Is anyone listening? Where's my money?</i>

126
00:08:36,047 --> 00:08:38,003
Oh, my God. The Fleet is moving.

127
00:08:38,087 --> 00:08:39,406
They're on their way!

128
00:08:44,807 --> 00:08:47,560
<i>Purify the Earth with fire.</i>

129
00:08:47,847 --> 00:08:52,363
<i>The planet will become my temple</i>
<i>and we shall rise.</i>

130
00:08:52,927 --> 00:08:57,523
<i>This will be our paradise!</i>

131
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,361
Dalek plan, big mistake,
'cause what've they left me with?

132
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:10,120
Anyone? Anyone? Come on, it's obvious!

133
00:09:10,487 --> 00:09:12,955
A great big transmitter. This station!

134
00:09:13,047 --> 00:09:16,119
If I can change the signal,
fold it back, sequence it? Anyone?

135
00:09:16,207 --> 00:09:18,516
-You've got to be kidding.
-Give the man a medal!

136
00:09:18,607 --> 00:09:20,723
-A Delta Wave?
-A Delta Wave!

137
00:09:20,807 --> 00:09:23,401
-What's a Delta Wave?
-A wave of Van Cassadyne energy.

138
00:09:23,487 --> 00:09:27,366
It fries your brain. Stand in the way
of a Delta Wave and your head gets barbecued.

139
00:09:27,447 --> 00:09:30,644
And this place can transmit a massive wave.
Wipe out the Daleks!

140
00:09:30,727 --> 00:09:32,479
Get started and do it, then!

141
00:09:32,567 --> 00:09:35,320
Trouble is, wave this size, building this big,
brain as clever as mine,

142
00:09:35,407 --> 00:09:37,125
should take about three days.

143
00:09:37,207 --> 00:09:40,324
-How long till the Fleet arrive?
-22 minutes.

144
00:09:52,727 --> 00:09:55,719
(JACK) We've now got a force-field,
so they can't blast us out of the sky.

145
00:09:55,807 --> 00:09:58,321
But that doesn't stop
the Daleks from physically invading.

146
00:09:58,407 --> 00:10:01,683
-Do they know about the Delta Wave?
-They'll have worked it out at the same time.

147
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:05,646
So, they want to stop the Doctor.
That means they've got to get to this level, 500.

148
00:10:05,727 --> 00:10:10,562
Now, I can concentrate the extrapolator
on the top six levels, 500 to 495.

149
00:10:10,887 --> 00:10:14,516
So they'll penetrate the station below that
at level 494 and fight their way up.

150
00:10:14,607 --> 00:10:16,040
-Who are they fighting?
-Us.

151
00:10:16,127 --> 00:10:17,560
What are we fighting with?

152
00:10:17,647 --> 00:10:21,003
The guards had guns with bastic bullets,
that's enough to blow a Dalek wide open.

153
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:22,566
There's five of us.

154
00:10:22,647 --> 00:10:25,639
Rose, you can help me.
I need all these wires stripping bare.

155
00:10:25,727 --> 00:10:28,241
-Right, now there's four of us.
-Then let's move it!

156
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:31,000
Into the lift, isolate the lift controls.

157
00:10:34,207 --> 00:10:38,564
I just wanna say...thanks, I suppose.

158
00:10:38,647 --> 00:10:41,798
-And I'll do my best.
-Me, too.

159
00:10:55,887 --> 00:10:57,525
It's been fun.

160
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,279
-But I guess this is goodbye.
-Don't talk like that.

161
00:11:02,567 --> 00:11:04,922
The Doctor's gonna do it, you just watch him.

162
00:11:05,007 --> 00:11:06,235
Rose.

163
00:11:09,047 --> 00:11:11,038
You are worth fighting for.

164
00:11:16,047 --> 00:11:17,924
Wish I'd never met you, Doctor.

165
00:11:19,047 --> 00:11:21,117
I was much better off as a coward.

166
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,245

169
00:11:45,847 --> 00:11:49,965
One last time! Any more volunteers?

170
00:11:54,327 --> 00:11:57,717
There's an army about to invade this station.

171
00:11:58,247 --> 00:12:00,556
I need every last citizen to mount a defence.

172
00:12:00,647 --> 00:12:03,923
Don't listen to him! There aren't any Daleks.

173
00:12:04,007 --> 00:12:06,567
They disappeared thousands of years ago.

174
00:12:08,487 --> 00:12:11,240
Thanks. As for the rest of you,

175
00:12:11,327 --> 00:12:15,798
the Daleks will enter the station at Floor 494,
and as far as I can tell,

176
00:12:15,887 --> 00:12:19,800
they'll head up, not down.
But that's not a promise.

177
00:12:20,487 --> 00:12:22,682
So here's a few words of advice.

178
00:12:23,807 --> 00:12:25,559
Keep quiet.

179
00:12:25,927 --> 00:12:29,602
And if you hear fighting up above,
if you hear us dying...

180
00:12:31,327 --> 00:12:34,239
then tell me that the Daleks aren't real.

181
00:12:38,927 --> 00:12:40,565
Don't make a sound.

00:12:41,767 --> 00:12:43,041

184
00:13:03,007 --> 00:13:05,123
-What?
-Nothing.

185
00:13:06,607 --> 00:13:09,519
-You said suppose.
-No, I was just thinking.

186
00:13:09,607 --> 00:13:13,600
I mean, obviously you can't,
but you've got a time machine.

187
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:16,525
Why can't you just go back to last week
and warn them?

Soon as the Tardis lands, in that second,
I become part of events. Stuck in the timeline.

189
00:13:21,087 --> 00:13:23,521
Yeah, I thought it'd be something like that.

190
00:13:25,047 --> 00:13:30,041
There's another thing the Tardis could do.
It could take us away. We could leave.

191
00:13:30,687 --> 00:13:34,965
Let history take its course.
We go to Marbella in 1 989.

192
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:38,477
-Yeah, but you'd never do that.
-No, but you could ask.

If I use the Tardis to cross
my own timeline.... Yes!

200
00:14:19,847 --> 00:14:21,280
Hold that down and keep position.

201

-Cancels the buffers.

-Me, too.

That's been there for years.
It's just a phrase, it's just words!

314
00:23:25,247 --> 00:23:28,159
I thought it was a warning.
Maybe it's the opposite.

315
00:23:28,247 --> 00:23:30,238
Maybe it's a message.

The same words written down now
and 200,000 years in the future.

It's a link between me and the Doctor.
Bad Wolf here, Bad Wolf there.

318
00:23:37,807 --> 00:23:39,559
Yeah, but if it's a message, what's it saying?

319
00:23:39,647 --> 00:23:43,162
It's telling me I can get back.
The least I can do is help him escape!

Stand your ground, everyone.
Follow my commands. And good luck.

321
00:23:52,287 --> 00:23:55,597
You were right.
They're forcing the air lock on 494.

322
00:24:13,207 --> 00:24:16,643
All the Tardis needs to do is
make a return trip. Just reverse.

323
00:24:16,727 --> 00:24:18,240
Yeah, but we still can't do it.

324
00:24:18,327 --> 00:24:22,320
The Doctor always said the Tardis was telepathic.

494
00:42:50,047 --> 00:42:52,880
I might never make sense again.
I might have two heads or no head!

495
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:56,684
Imagine me with no head.
And don't say that's an improvement!

496
00:42:57,567 --> 00:42:59,956
But it's a bit dodgy this process.

497
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,482
You never know what you're gonna end up with.

498
00:43:03,967 --> 00:43:05,878
-Doctor!
-Stay away!

499
00:43:07,687 --> 00:43:09,200
Doctor, tell me what's going on.

500
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:12,962
I absorbed all the energy of the time vortex
and no one's meant to do that.

501
00:43:17,767 --> 00:43:19,598
Every cell in my body is dying.

502
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:23,484
-Can't you do something?
-Yeah, I'm doing it now!

503
00:43:24,007 --> 00:43:28,398
Time Lords have this little trick.
It's sort of a way of cheating death.

504
00:43:31,047 --> 00:43:32,275
Except...

505
00:43:34,767 --> 00:43:36,439
it means I'm gonna change...

506
00:43:39,247 --> 00:43:41,203
and I'm not gonna see you again.

507
00:43:42,487 --> 00:43:45,559
Not like this, not with this daft old face.

508
00:43:47,927 --> 00:43:49,565
-And before I go....
-Don't say that!

509
00:43:49,647 --> 00:43:50,796
Rose...

510
00:43:52,927 --> 00:43:56,283
before I go I just wanna tell you,
you were fantastic.

511
00:43:58,127 --> 00:43:59,845
Absolutely fantastic.

512
00:44:02,887 --> 00:44:04,400
And do you know what?

513
00:44:07,607 --> 00:44:09,006
So was I.

514
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:31,685
Hello, okay.

515
00:44:34,847 --> 00:44:37,964
New teeth, that's weird. So, where was I?

516
00:44:38,567 --> 00:44:41,240
Oh, that's right, Barcelona!
