-Why do you want to know that?

174
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:50,679
I'm not a copper. What's a copper
going to do with you lot anyway?

175
00:14:50,767 --> 00:14:52,405

You lot shouldn't even be in London.

Should've been evacuated
to the country by now.

178

I was evacuated. Sent me to a farm.

-So why'd you come back?
-There was a man there.

180
00:15:04,127 --> 00:15:06,197
Yeah. Same with Ernie. Two homes ago.

181
00:15:06,287 --> 00:15:09,677
Shut up. It's better on the streets
anyway. It's better food.

182
00:15:09,767 --> 00:15:12,235
(JIM) Yeah. Nancy always gets
the best food for us.

183
00:15:12,327 --> 00:15:14,761
-So that's what you do, is it, Nancy?
-What is?

184
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:18,556
Soon as the sirens go, you find a big,
fat family meal, still warm on the table,

185
00:15:18,647 --> 00:15:21,081
with everyone down
in the air raid shelter and bingo.

-Something wrong with that?
-Wrong? It's brilliant.

189

I'm not sure if it's Marxism in action
or a West End musical.

190

Why'd you follow me? What do you want?

191
00:15:36,407 --> 00:15:39,444
I want to know how a phone
that isn't a phone gets a phone call.

192

-You seem to be the one to ask.
-I did you a favour.

193
00:15:42,327 --> 00:15:44,795
I told you not to answer it.
That's all I'm telling you.

194
00:15:44,887 --> 00:15:47,765
Great, thanks. And I want to find
a blonde in a Union Jack.

195
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:51,760
I mean, a specific one, I didn't just
wake up this morning with a craving.

196

-You took two slices.

No blondes, no flags.

199
00:16:00,407 --> 00:16:04,161
-Anything else before you leave?
-There is, actually. Thanks for asking.

Something I've been looking for.

201
00:16:05,567 --> 00:16:08,161
Would've fallen from the sky
a month ago, but not a bomb.

202
00:16:08,247 --> 00:16:10,602
Not the usual kind anyway.
Wouldn't have exploded.

203
00:16:10,687 --> 00:16:13,201
Probably would've buried itself
in the ground somewhere.

204
00:16:13,287 --> 00:16:17,075
And it would've looked something
like this.

-I do, actually, yes.

It has nothing to do with this.

509
00:37:38,287 --> 00:37:41,677
This started at the bomb site.
It's got everything to do with it.

510
00:37:41,767 --> 00:37:43,917
-What kind of warship?
-An ambulance.

511
00:37:45,927 --> 00:37:49,715
Look. That's what you chased
through the time vortex.

512
00:37:50,127 --> 00:37:54,279
It's space junk, I wanted to kid you
it was valuable, it's empty.

513
00:37:54,567 --> 00:37:56,717
I made sure of it, nothing but a shell.

514
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:58,160
I threw it at you.

515
00:37:58,287 --> 00:38:01,324
Saw your time travel vehicle,
love the retro look by the way,

516
00:38:01,407 --> 00:38:04,126
-nice panels, threw you the bait....
-Bait?

517
00:38:04,607 --> 00:38:08,077
I wanted to sell it to you, then destroy it
before you found it was junk.

518
00:38:08,167 --> 00:38:11,318
-You said it was a warship.
-They have ambulances in wars.

519
00:38:14,247 --> 00:38:16,556
It's a con. I was conning you.

520
00:38:16,647 --> 00:38:19,844
That's what I am, I'm a con man.
Thought you were Time Agents.

521
00:38:19,927 --> 00:38:22,919
-You're not, are you?
-Just a couple more freelancers.

522
00:38:23,007 --> 00:38:27,205
Oh! Should've known, the way you guys
are blending in with the local colour.

523
00:38:27,287 --> 00:38:30,006
Flag Girl was bad enough,
but U-boat Captain?

524
00:38:31,087 --> 00:38:35,717
Anyway, whatever's happening here
has got nothing to do with that ship.

525
00:38:35,807 --> 00:38:38,116
What is happening here, Doctor?

526
00:38:39,207 --> 00:38:41,402
Human DNA is being rewritten.

527
00:38:41,887 --> 00:38:43,957
-By an idiot.
-What do you mean?

528
00:38:44,047 --> 00:38:47,722
I don't know, some kind of virus.
Converting humans into these things.

529
00:38:47,807 --> 00:38:50,480
But why? What's the point?

530
00:38:53,687 --> 00:38:54,802
Mummy.

531
00:38:58,527 --> 00:39:00,085
Where's my mummy?

532
00:39:01,367 --> 00:39:02,561
Mummy.

533
00:39:28,607 --> 00:39:30,245
Are you my mummy?

534
00:39:35,527 --> 00:39:37,085
Mummy.

535
00:39:37,767 --> 00:39:39,359
(PATIENTS) Mummy.

536
00:39:39,447 --> 00:39:41,324
Mummy.

537
00:39:41,407 --> 00:39:43,875
-What's happening?
- (DOCTOR) I don't know.

538
00:39:48,967 --> 00:39:50,195
Mummy.

539
00:39:50,727 --> 00:39:52,763
It's me. Nancy.

540
00:39:54,847 --> 00:39:56,200
Don't let them touch you.

541
00:39:56,287 --> 00:39:59,279
-What happens if they touch us?
-You're looking at it.

542
00:40:01,247 --> 00:40:05,240
-Are you my mummy?
-It's Nancy, your sister.

543
00:40:08,527 --> 00:40:11,166
You're dead, Jamie. You're dead.

544
00:40:11,287 --> 00:40:13,278
Mummy.

545
00:40:13,727 --> 00:40:16,161
Mummy.

546
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,761
(ALL) Mummy. Mummy....

547
00:40:19,727 --> 00:40:22,764
-Mummy.
-Mummy.

548
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:24,800
Mummy....

549
00:41:07,287 --> 00:41:10,120
I don't know what's happening
but I had nothing to do with it.

550
00:41:10,207 --> 00:41:11,435
I'll tell you what's happening.

551
00:41:11,527 --> 00:41:14,280
You forgot to set your alarm clock.
It's Volcano Day.

552
00:41:15,047 --> 00:41:16,878
That door should hold it for a bit.

553
00:41:16,967 --> 00:41:18,923
The door? The wall didn't stop it.

554
00:41:19,447 --> 00:41:20,960
Halt. Don't move.

555
00:41:21,047 --> 00:41:22,878
Go on, ask me anything, I'm on fire.

556
00:41:22,967 --> 00:41:25,117
You've got the moves,
show me your moves.

557
00:41:25,207 --> 00:41:27,562
The world doesn't end
'cause the Doctor dances.

558
00:41:27,647 --> 00:41:28,796
Stay back.

559
00:41:30,127 --> 00:41:31,162
Mummy.

560
00:41:31,807 --> 00:41:33,320
-Doctor.
-Secure those gates.

561
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:34,760
-Why?
-Just do it.

562
00:41:34,887 --> 00:41:37,959
All that weapons tech in the hands
of an hysterical four-year-old

563
00:41:38,047 --> 00:41:39,400
looking for his mummy.

564
00:41:39,487 --> 00:41:41,717
And nothing in the world can stop it.
