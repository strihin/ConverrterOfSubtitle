00:14:36,727 --> 00:14:38,445
- How do you know?
- I'm your...

167
00:14:38,607 --> 00:14:40,120
Number one fan. Yes.

168
00:14:44,447 --> 00:14:49,077
- What are we going to do with her?
- I don't know.

169
00:14:49,247 --> 00:14:54,367
I didn't plan any of this.
It isn't my fault if the dead won't stay dead.

170
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:58,725
Then whose fault is it, sir?
Why is this happening to us?

171
00:15:06,807 --> 00:15:09,275
(TAPPING)

172
00:15:11,287 --> 00:15:13,721
I did the bishop a favour once -

173
00:15:13,887 --> 00:15:18,165
made his nephew look like a cherub
though he'd been a fortnight in the weir.

174
00:15:18,327 --> 00:15:22,081
Perhaps he'll do us an exorcism
on the cheap.

175
00:15:22,247 --> 00:15:27,196
- (KNOCKING)
- Say I'm not in. Just get rid of them.

176
00:15:30,927 --> 00:15:34,886
(SOFT HISSING WHISPERING)

177
00:15:44,287 --> 00:15:46,084
- We're closed.
- Nonsense.

178
00:15:46,247 --> 00:15:50,399
Undertakers don't keep office hours.
The dead don't die on schedule.

179
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:52,717
- I demand to see your master.
- He's not in.

180
00:15:52,887 --> 00:15:55,685
Don't lie to me, child! Summon him.

181
00:15:55,847 --> 00:15:59,442
I'm sorry, Mr Dickens,
but the master's indisposed.

182
00:15:59,607 --> 00:16:04,761
- Having trouble with your gas?
- What the Shakespeare is going on?

183
00:16:07,087 --> 00:16:09,203
(GROANING)

184
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,878
Are you all right?

185
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:20,957
You're kidding me, yeah?
You are kidding me, aren't you?

186
00:16:21,127 --> 00:16:23,436
OK. No kidding.

187
00:16:26,207 --> 00:16:30,200
- You're not allowed in, sir.
- There's something in the walls.

188
00:16:30,367 --> 00:16:33,040
(GROANING)

189
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:37,802
The gas pipes.
Something's living inside the gas.

190
00:16:43,087 --> 00:16:45,681
Let me out! Open the door!

191
00:16:45,847 --> 00:16:48,077
- That's her.
- Please let me out!

192
00:16:50,607 --> 00:16:54,600
- How dare you, sir? This is my house!
- Shut up!

193
00:16:55,607 --> 00:16:56,926
I told you...

194
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:59,885
Let me out! Somebody open the door!

195
00:17:02,727 --> 00:17:04,206
Open the door!

196
00:17:11,047 --> 00:17:13,038
I think this is my dance.

197
00:17:15,127 --> 00:17:19,040
It's a prank.
We're under some mesmeric influence.

198
00:17:19,207 --> 00:17:22,882
- No. The dead are walking. Hi.
- Hi. Who's your friend?

199
00:17:23,047 --> 00:17:25,720
- Charles Dickens.
- OK.

200
00:17:25,887 --> 00:17:28,242
I'm the Doctor. Who are you?

201
00:17:28,407 --> 00:17:31,479
(ECHOING) Failing.
Open the rift. We're dying.

202
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:35,117
Trapped in this form. Cannot sustain. Help us.

203
00:17:36,167 --> 00:17:38,840
(SCREAMING)

204
00:17:50,647 --> 00:17:53,207
First you drug me, then you kidnap me -

205
00:17:53,367 --> 00:17:56,359
and I felt your hands having a quick wander!

206
00:17:56,527 --> 00:18:00,406
- I won't be spoken to like this!
- You put me in a room full of zombies!

207
00:18:00,567 --> 00:18:05,641
- You swan off and leave me to die!
- It's not my fault! It's this house.

208
00:18:07,927 --> 00:18:10,680
It always had a reputation.

209
00:18:10,847 --> 00:18:15,762
Haunted. I never had much bother
until three months back. Then the stiffs...

210
00:18:17,567 --> 00:18:23,403
The...dear departed...
started getting restless.

211
00:18:23,567 --> 00:18:26,001
- Tommy-rot!
- You witnessed it.

212
00:18:26,167 --> 00:18:30,604
Can't keep the beggars down, sir. They walk.

213
00:18:30,767 --> 00:18:33,725
The queerest thing,
they hang on to scraps...

214
00:18:33,887 --> 00:18:35,684
Two sugars, sir. How you like it.

215
00:18:35,847 --> 00:18:39,442
One old sexton almost went
to his own memorial service.

216
00:18:39,607 --> 00:18:43,441
Just like the old lady
going to your performance, sir.

217
00:18:43,607 --> 00:18:46,405
- Morbid fancy.
- Charles, you were there.

218
00:18:46,567 --> 00:18:53,040
- I saw nothing but an illusion.
- If you're going to deny it, just shut up.

219
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:59,885
- What about the gas?
- That's new, sir. I've never seen that.

220
00:19:00,047 --> 00:19:03,357
The rift's getting wider
and something's getting through.

221
00:19:03,527 --> 00:19:05,995
- What's a rift?
- A weak point in time and space.

222
00:19:06,167 --> 00:19:10,046
A connection with another place.
That's the cause of ghost stories.

223
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:15,679
That's how I got the house so cheap.
Stories going back generations.

224
00:19:15,847 --> 00:19:18,839
Echoes in the dark, queer songs in the air

225
00:19:19,007 --> 00:19:23,717
and this feeling like a shadow
passing over your soul.

226
00:19:25,687 --> 00:19:30,966
It's been good for business. What people
expect from a gloomy old trade like mine.

227
00:19:35,887 --> 00:19:38,526
(SOFT WHISPERING)

228
00:19:45,087 --> 00:19:46,884
Impossible.

229
00:20:02,927 --> 00:20:04,918
Checking for strings?

230
00:20:05,087 --> 00:20:09,797
Wires, perhaps. There must be
some mechanism behind this fraud.

231
00:20:09,967 --> 00:20:14,119
Oh, come on, Charles.
I shouldn't have told you to shut up.

232
00:20:14,287 --> 00:20:17,643
I'm sorry. You've got
one of the best minds in the world.

233
00:20:17,807 --> 00:20:20,275
- You saw the gas creatures.
- I cannot accept...

234
00:20:20,447 --> 00:20:24,725
What does the human body do
when it decomposes? It produces gas.

235
00:20:24,887 --> 00:20:28,721
Perfect home for these gas things.
They can use it as a vehicle.

236
00:20:28,887 --> 00:20:31,401
- Just like your coach.
- Stop it.

237
00:20:31,567 --> 00:20:35,958
Can it be that I have the world entirely wrong?

238
00:20:36,127 --> 00:20:41,042
- Not wrong. There's just more to learn.
- I've always railed against the fantasist.

239
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:46,076
I've always loved an illusion,
but that's exactly what they were - illusions.

240
00:20:46,247 --> 00:20:50,206
The real world is something else.

241
00:20:50,367 --> 00:20:56,124
I dedicated myself to that -
injustices, the great social causes.

242
00:20:56,287 --> 00:20:59,120
I hoped that I was a force for good.

243
00:21:00,007 --> 00:21:05,525
Now you tell me that the real world
is a realm of spectres

244
00:21:05,687 --> 00:21:08,440
and jack-o'-lanterns.

245
00:21:08,607 --> 00:21:13,727
In which case, have I wasted
my brief span here, Doctor?

246
00:21:15,127 --> 00:21:17,436
Has it all been for nothing?

247
00:21:22,127 --> 00:21:28,396
- Miss, you shouldn't be helping.
- Don't be daft. Sneed works you to death.

248
00:21:30,967 --> 00:21:34,642
- How much do you get paid?
- Eight pound a year, miss.

249
00:21:34,807 --> 00:21:38,356
- How much?
- I know. I would have been happy with six.

250
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:45,319
- So did you even go to school or what?
- Of course I did.

251
00:21:45,487 --> 00:21:50,925
What do you think I am, an urchin?
I went every Sunday, nice and proper.

252
00:21:51,087 --> 00:21:55,046
- Once a week?
- We did sums and everything.

253
00:21:56,287 --> 00:22:00,803
- To be honest, I hated every second.
- Me too.

254
00:22:05,287 --> 00:22:11,362
Don't tell anyone, but one week...I didn't go
and I runned on the heath on my own!

255
00:22:11,527 --> 00:22:15,839
I did plenty of that. I used to go
round the shops with my mate Shereen.

256
00:22:16,007 --> 00:22:21,206
- We used to go and look at boys.
- I don't know much about that, miss.

257
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:26,166
Times haven't changed that much.
I bet you've done the same.

258
00:22:26,327 --> 00:22:30,445
- I don't think so, miss.
- Gwyneth, you can tell me.

259
00:22:30,607 --> 00:22:33,405
I bet you've got your eye on someone.

260
00:22:34,407 --> 00:22:39,765
I suppose...
There is one lad. The butcher's boy.

261
00:22:39,927 --> 00:22:44,523
He comes by every Tuesday.
Such a lovely smile on him.

262
00:22:44,687 --> 00:22:47,997
I like a nice smile. Good smile. Nice bum.

263
00:22:49,007 --> 00:22:51,237
Well, I've never heard the like!

264
00:22:52,527 --> 00:22:56,805
Ask him out. Give him a cup of tea
or something. That's a start.

265
00:22:56,967 --> 00:23:00,164
I swear it is the strangest thing, miss.

266
00:23:00,327 --> 00:23:05,447
You've got the clothes and the breeding,
but you talk like some sort of wild thing.

267
00:23:06,967 --> 00:23:11,199
Maybe I am. Maybe that's a good thing.

268
00:23:12,647 --> 00:23:16,083
You need a bit more in your life
than Mr Sneed.

269
00:23:16,247 --> 00:23:22,004
That's not fair. He's not so bad, old Sneed.
He was very kind to take me in.

270
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:25,000
I lost my mum and dad
to the flu when I was 12.

271
00:23:25,167 --> 00:23:26,646
I'm sorry.

272
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:34,203
Thank you, miss. But I'll be with them again
one day - sitting with them in paradise.

273
00:23:34,367 --> 00:23:36,927
I shall be so blessed.

274
00:23:37,087 --> 00:23:41,797
They're waiting for me. Maybe your dad's
up there waiting for you too, miss.

275
00:23:41,967 --> 00:23:43,958
Maybe.

276
00:23:45,287 --> 00:23:47,517
Um... Who told you he was dead?

277
00:23:50,647 --> 00:23:53,559
I don't know. Must have been the Doctor.

278
00:23:53,727 --> 00:23:55,922
My father died years back.

279
00:23:56,087 --> 00:23:59,523
But you've been thinking about him lately.

280
00:23:59,687 --> 00:24:03,805
I suppose so. How do you know all this?

281
00:24:04,927 --> 00:24:07,725
Mr Sneed says I think too much.

282
00:24:07,887 --> 00:24:12,677
I'm all alone down here. I bet you've got
dozens of servants, haven't you?

283
00:24:12,847 --> 00:24:17,682
- No. No servants where I'm from.
- And you've come such a long way.

284
00:24:17,847 --> 00:24:20,566
What makes you think so?

285
00:24:22,407 --> 00:24:28,039
You're from London. I've seen London
in drawings, but never like that.

286
00:24:29,087 --> 00:24:34,764
All those people rushing about, half-naked.
For shame.

287
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:37,758
And the noise...

288
00:24:37,927 --> 00:24:41,124
And the metal boxes racing past.

289
00:24:42,127 --> 00:24:46,405
And the birds in the sky...
No, they're metal as well.

290
00:24:46,567 --> 00:24:51,721
Metal birds with people in them.
People are flying.

291
00:24:51,887 --> 00:24:55,641
And you've flown so far,
further than anyone.

292
00:24:55,807 --> 00:24:58,446
The things you've seen.

293
00:24:58,607 --> 00:25:02,646
The darkness... The Big Bad Wolf.

294
00:25:05,287 --> 00:25:07,847
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry, miss.
- It's all right.

295
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:12,205
Ever since I was a little girl,
my mam said I had the sight.

296
00:25:12,367 --> 00:25:14,881
But it's getting stronger, more powerful?

297
00:25:17,047 --> 00:25:19,686
All the time, sir.

298
00:25:19,847 --> 00:25:23,920
Every night...voices in my head.

299
00:25:24,087 --> 00:25:28,126
You grew up on top of the rift.
You're part of it. You're the key.

300
00:25:28,287 --> 00:25:31,279
I've tried to make sense of it, sir.

301
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:36,885
Consulted with spiritualists,
table rappers, all sorts.

302
00:25:37,047 --> 00:25:39,641
That should help.
You can show us what to do.

303
00:25:41,007 --> 00:25:44,886
- What do to where, sir?
- We're going to have a seance.

304
00:25:45,847 --> 00:25:49,044
(HORSE WHINNIES, WIND HOWLS)

305
00:25:49,207 --> 00:25:54,122
This is how Madam Mortlock summons
those from the Land of Mists. Come...

306
00:25:54,287 --> 00:25:56,198
- Join hands.
- I can't take part.

307
00:25:56,367 --> 00:25:58,676
Humbug? Come on. Open mind.

308
00:25:58,847 --> 00:26:02,886
This is precisely the sort of cheap mummery
I strive to unmask.

309
00:26:03,047 --> 00:26:04,799
Seances?

310
00:26:04,967 --> 00:26:09,836
Nothing but luminous tambourines and
a squeeze-box concealed between the knees.

311
00:26:10,007 --> 00:26:12,965
- This girl knows nothing.
- Don't antagonise her.

312
00:26:13,127 --> 00:26:16,756
- I love a happy medium.
- I can't believe you said that.

313
00:26:16,927 --> 00:26:19,395
Come on. We might need you.

314
00:26:22,767 --> 00:26:25,884
Good man. Now, Gwyneth...

315
00:26:26,047 --> 00:26:28,038
Reach out.

316
00:26:31,167 --> 00:26:33,158
Speak to us.

317
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:38,802

318
00:26:40,007 --> 00:26:43,079
Speak to us that we may relieve your burden.

- (WHISPERING)
- Can you hear that?

320
00:26:47,767 --> 00:26:51,760
- Nothing can happen. This is sheer folly.
- Look at her.

321
00:26:51,927 --> 00:26:53,997
I see them.

322
00:26:55,167 --> 00:26:57,158
I feel them.

323
00:27:09,167 --> 00:27:11,806
- What's it saying?
- It can't get through.

324
00:27:11,967 --> 00:27:15,323
You're controlling it.
Look deep. Allow them through.

325
00:27:15,487 --> 00:27:16,966
- I can't.
- You can.

326
00:27:17,127 --> 00:27:20,005
Just believe it.
I have faith in you, Gwyneth.

327
00:27:20,167 --> 00:27:22,203
Make the link.

328
00:27:23,847 --> 00:27:25,166
Yes.

329
00:27:32,687 --> 00:27:37,203
Great God! Spirits from the other side.

330
00:27:37,367 --> 00:27:39,642
The other side of the universe.

331
00:27:39,807 --> 00:27:45,837
(HIGH ECHOING VOICE) Pity us.
Pity the Gelth. There is so little time. Help us.

332
00:27:46,007 --> 00:27:48,396
- What do you want us to do?
- The rift.

333
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:52,196
- Take the girl to the rift. Make a bridge.
- What for?

334
00:27:52,367 --> 00:27:57,361
We are so very few - the last of our kind.
We face extinction.

335
00:27:57,527 --> 00:27:59,916
Why? What happened?

336
00:28:00,087 --> 00:28:03,284
We had a physical form like you,
but then the war came...

337
00:28:03,447 --> 00:28:05,438
War? What war?

338
00:28:05,607 --> 00:28:10,203
The Time War. The whole universe convulsed.

339
00:28:10,367 --> 00:28:13,006
The Time War raged.

340
00:28:13,167 --> 00:28:17,877
Invisible to smaller species,
but devastating to higher forms.

341
00:28:18,047 --> 00:28:20,481
Our bodies wasted away.

342
00:28:21,647 --> 00:28:24,684
We're trapped in this gaseous state.

343
00:28:24,847 --> 00:28:26,963
That's why you need the corpses.

344
00:28:27,127 --> 00:28:32,918
We want to stand tall,
to feel the sunlight, to live again.

345
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:38,002
We need a physical form
and your dead are abandoned.

346
00:28:38,167 --> 00:28:41,239
- They go to waste. Give them to us.
- But we can't.

347
00:28:41,407 --> 00:28:44,399
- Why not?
- It's not... I mean, it's not...

348
00:28:44,567 --> 00:28:46,876
Not decent? It could save their lives.

349
00:28:47,047 --> 00:28:51,757
Open the rift. Let the Gelth through.

350
00:28:51,927 --> 00:28:55,476
We're dying. Help us. Pity the Gelth.

351
00:28:59,207 --> 00:29:00,526
Gwyneth?

352
00:29:02,447 --> 00:29:04,005
All true.

353
00:29:04,167 --> 00:29:05,919
Are you OK?

354
00:29:06,927 --> 00:29:08,997
It's all true.

355
00:29:11,807 --> 00:29:14,446
(CLOCK CHIMES)

356
00:29:18,607 --> 00:29:21,519
It's all right. You just sleep.

357
00:29:21,687 --> 00:29:25,680
But my angels, miss...
They came, didn't they? They need me.

358
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:29,635
- They do. You're their only chance.
- Leave her alone.

359
00:29:29,807 --> 00:29:33,959
She's exhausted
and she's not fighting your battles.

360
00:29:35,887 --> 00:29:37,240
Drink this.

361
00:29:37,407 --> 00:29:41,719
What did you say, Doctor?
Explain it again. What are they?

362
00:29:41,887 --> 00:29:43,240
Aliens.

363
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:47,002
- Like foreigners?
- Pretty foreign, yeah. From up there.

364
00:29:47,167 --> 00:29:48,725
- Brecon?
- Close.

365
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:52,402
They want to get from Brecon to Cardiff,
but the road's blocked.

366
00:29:52,567 --> 00:29:54,717
Only a few get through and they're weak.

367
00:29:54,887 --> 00:29:59,165
They can only test-drive the bodies
for so long, then they revert to gas.

368
00:29:59,327 --> 00:30:02,239
- Which is why they need the girl.
- No.

369
00:30:02,407 --> 00:30:07,765
But she can help. She can open up the rift,
make a bridge and let them through.

370
00:30:07,927 --> 00:30:12,955
Incredible. Ghosts that are not ghosts,
but beings from another world,

371
00:30:13,127 --> 00:30:17,518
who can only exist in our world
by inhabiting cadavers.

372
00:30:17,687 --> 00:30:19,040
Good system.

373
00:30:21,007 --> 00:30:24,761
- You can't let them inside dead people.
- Why not? It's recycling.

374
00:30:24,927 --> 00:30:27,361
- Seriously, you can't.
- Seriously, I can!

375
00:30:27,527 --> 00:30:33,284
It's wrong. Those bodies were living people.
We should respect them even in death.

376
00:30:33,447 --> 00:30:36,484
- Do you carry a donor card?
- It's different.

377
00:30:36,647 --> 00:30:40,083
Yes, it's a different morality.
Get used to it or go home.

378
00:30:42,447 --> 00:30:47,567
Time's short. I can't worry about a few corpses
when the Gelth could be dying.

379
00:30:47,727 --> 00:30:52,198
- I don't care. They're not using her.
- Don't I get a say, miss?

380
00:30:52,367 --> 00:30:55,723
Look...you don't understand what's going on.

381
00:30:55,887 --> 00:31:00,836
You would say that, miss,
because inside your head you think I'm stupid.

382
00:31:01,007 --> 00:31:03,202
- That's not fair.
- It's true, though.

383
00:31:03,367 --> 00:31:10,079
Things might be different where you're from,
but here and now I know my own mind

384
00:31:10,247 --> 00:31:12,636
and the angels need me.

385
00:31:12,807 --> 00:31:16,641
- Doctor, what do I have to do?
- You don't have to do anything.

386
00:31:16,807 --> 00:31:19,958
They've been singing to me
since I was a child,

387
00:31:20,127 --> 00:31:22,482
sent by my mam on holy mission.

388
00:31:23,327 --> 00:31:27,115
- So tell me.
- We need to find the rift.

389
00:31:28,287 --> 00:31:33,998
This house is on a weak spot. Mr Sneed,
what's the weakest part of this house?

390
00:31:34,167 --> 00:31:40,003
- The place where most ghosts are seen.
- That would be the morgue.

391
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:43,398
Any chance you were going to say gazebo?

392
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:51,404

393
00:31:56,607 --> 00:31:58,723
Talk about Bleak House.

394
00:31:58,887 --> 00:32:01,685
Doctor, the Gelth don't succeed.

395
00:32:01,847 --> 00:32:06,204
I know they don't. I know corpses
weren't walking around in 1869.

396
00:32:06,367 --> 00:32:10,519
Time's changing every second.
Your world can be rewritten like that.

397
00:32:10,687 --> 00:32:14,157
- Nothing is safe. Remember that. Nothing.
- Doctor...

398
00:32:14,327 --> 00:32:16,522
I think the room is getting colder.

399
00:32:19,487 --> 00:32:21,717
Here they come.

400
00:32:23,287 --> 00:32:26,996
You've come to help.
Praise the Doctor! Praise him!

401
00:32:27,167 --> 00:32:32,446
- Promise you won't hurt her.
- Hurry. So little time. Pity the Gelth.

402
00:32:33,447 --> 00:32:37,963
I'll take you somewhere else after.
Somewhere you can build bodies.

403
00:32:38,127 --> 00:32:40,243
This isn't a permanent solution.

404
00:32:40,407 --> 00:32:42,875
My angels. I can help them live.

405
00:32:43,967 --> 00:32:47,482
- Where's the weak point?
- Here. Beneath the arch.

406
00:32:47,647 --> 00:32:49,478
Beneath the arch.

407
00:32:49,647 --> 00:32:52,957
- You don't have to do this.
- My angels.

408
00:32:53,127 --> 00:32:56,278
Establish the bridge out of the void,
let us through.

409
00:32:56,447 --> 00:32:58,085
Yes.

410
00:32:58,247 --> 00:33:02,923
I can see you. I can see you... Come.

411
00:33:03,087 --> 00:33:08,798
- Bridgehead establishing.
- Come to this world, poor lost souls.

412
00:33:09,967 --> 00:33:12,765
It is begun. The bridge is made.

413
00:33:14,407 --> 00:33:19,527
- She has given herself to the Gelth.
- There's rather a lot of them.

414
00:33:19,687 --> 00:33:21,996
The bridge is open. We descend.

415
00:33:26,127 --> 00:33:28,880
(DEEP VOICE)
The Gelth will come through in force.

416
00:33:29,047 --> 00:33:31,515
(DICKENS) You said you were few in number.

417
00:33:31,687 --> 00:33:35,680
A few billion.
And all of us in need of corpses.

418
00:33:39,007 --> 00:33:42,079
Oh, Gwyneth... Stop this!

419
00:33:43,167 --> 00:33:45,965
Listen to your master.
This has gone far enough.

420

Stop dabbling, child,
and leave these things alone, I beg of you.

Mr Sneed!

422
00:34:08,327 --> 00:34:14,436
- I think it's gone a little bit wrong.
- I have joined the legions of the Gelth.

423
00:34:14,607 --> 00:34:17,599
Come. March with us.

424
00:34:17,767 --> 00:34:19,325
No...

425
00:34:21,087 --> 00:34:22,679
We need bodies.

426
00:34:22,847 --> 00:34:27,796
All of you...dead. The human race...dead.

427
00:34:27,967 --> 00:34:29,764
Gwyneth, send them back!

428
00:34:29,927 --> 00:34:33,476

Make them vessels for the Gelth.

(DICKENS) Doctor, I can't... Sorry.

430
00:34:36,567 --> 00:34:40,321

- I'm so...
- (SCREAMING)

00:34:44,927 --> 00:34:48,840
Give yourself to glory.
Sacrifice your lives to the Gelth.

- We don't want your pity!

- We want this world and all its flesh!
- Not while I'm alive.

435
00:34:56,807 --> 00:34:58,286
Then live no more.

I haven't even been born yet.
It's impossible for me to die.

Time isn't a straight line.
It can twist into any shape.

446

You can be born in the 20th century
and die in the 19th and it's my fault.

447
00:35:57,127 --> 00:35:59,118
I brought you here.

448
00:36:00,287 --> 00:36:03,279
It's not your fault. I wanted to come.

449
00:36:03,447 --> 00:36:06,962
What about me? I saw the fall of Troy,
World War Five.

450
00:36:07,127 --> 00:36:12,042
I pushed boxes at the Boston Tea Party.
Now I'm going to die in a dungeon...

451
00:36:12,207 --> 00:36:14,004
in Cardiff!

452
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:19,922

We're going to become one of them.

- Yeah.

- Together?
- Yeah.

00:36:39,887 --> 00:36:42,447
I'm so glad I met you.

457
00:36:43,447 --> 00:36:45,642
Me too.

458
00:36:46,487 --> 00:36:50,116
Doctor! Doctor!
Turn off the flame, turn up the gas!

459
00:36:50,287 --> 00:36:52,926
- Fill the room now!
- What are you doing?

460
00:36:53,087 --> 00:36:56,159
Turn it all on. Flood the place!

461
00:36:56,327 --> 00:37:00,206
- Brilliant. Gas.
- So we choke to death instead?

462
00:37:00,367 --> 00:37:04,758
Am I correct, Doctor?
These creatures are gaseous.

463
00:37:04,927 --> 00:37:10,638
Fill the room with gas, it'll draw them
out of the host - like poison from a wound.

464
00:37:10,807 --> 00:37:13,526
I hope... Oh, Lord.

465
00:37:14,727 --> 00:37:19,403
I hope that this theory
will be validated soon...if not immediately.

466

Gwyneth! Send them back!
They lied. They're not angels.

- Liars?
- Look at me.

470
00:37:42,087 --> 00:37:45,841
If your mother and father could see this,
they'd tell you the same.

471
00:37:46,007 --> 00:37:48,362
They'd give you strength.
Send them back.

- I can't breathe.
- Charles, get her out.

- I'm not leaving her!
- They're too strong.

00:37:54,127 --> 00:38:00,202
Remember Rose's world? None of it will exist
unless you send them back through the rift.

475
00:38:00,367 --> 00:38:02,756
I can't send them back.

476
00:38:03,847 --> 00:38:08,238
But I can hold them.
Hold them in this place, hold them here.

477
00:38:10,007 --> 00:38:12,441
Get out.

- You can't!
- Leave this place!

479
00:38:14,767 --> 00:38:17,964
Get out! I won't leave her
while she's in danger.

- She didn't make it.
- I'm sorry. She closed the rift.

At such a cost. The poor child.

486
00:39:22,367 --> 00:39:25,200
I did try, but Gwyneth was already dead.

487
00:39:25,367 --> 00:39:28,916
- She had been for at least five minutes.
- What do you mean?

488
00:39:30,207 --> 00:39:32,641
She was dead when she stood in that arch.

00:39:32,807 --> 00:39:38,325
But she can't have... She spoke to us.
She helped us. She saved us.

490
00:39:38,487 --> 00:39:40,478
How could she have done that?

''There are more things in heaven and earth

492

Even for you, Doctor.

493
00:39:53,047 --> 00:39:58,246
She saved the world. A servant girl.
No one will ever know.

494
00:40:12,647 --> 00:40:16,686
Right, then, Charlie boy.
I've just got to go into my...shed.

495
00:40:17,847 --> 00:40:20,805
- Won't be long.
- What are you going to do now?

496
00:40:20,967 --> 00:40:24,642
I shall take the mail coach back to London,
post-haste.

497
00:40:24,807 --> 00:40:27,401
This is no time for me to be on my own.

498
00:40:27,567 --> 00:40:31,560
I shall spend Christmas
with my family and make amends to them.

499
00:40:31,727 --> 00:40:35,845
After all I've learned tonight,
there can be nothing more vital.

500
00:40:36,007 --> 00:40:38,237
- You've cheered up.
- Exceedingly.

501
00:40:39,327 --> 00:40:43,764
I thought I knew everything in the world.
Now I know I've just started.

502
00:40:43,927 --> 00:40:49,923
All these huge and wonderful notions.
I'm inspired. I must write about them.

503
00:40:50,087 --> 00:40:53,682
- Do you think that's wise?
- I shall be subtle...at first.

504
00:40:53,847 --> 00:40:57,601
''The Mystery Of Edwin Drood''
still lacks an ending.

505
00:40:57,767 --> 00:41:02,079
Perhaps the killer was not the boy's uncle.

506
00:41:02,247 --> 00:41:05,080
Perhaps he was not of this earth.

507

''The Mystery Of Edwin Drood
And The Blue Elementals''.

508
00:41:10,767 --> 00:41:12,723
I can spread the word, the truth.

509
00:41:13,727 --> 00:41:16,719
Good luck with it.
Nice to meet you. Fantastic.

510
00:41:16,887 --> 00:41:19,082
Bye, then. And thanks.

511
00:41:21,327 --> 00:41:24,364
Oh, my dear... How modern.

512
00:41:25,647 --> 00:41:28,445
Thank you. But I don't understand...

513
00:41:28,607 --> 00:41:31,519
In what way is this goodbye?

514
00:41:31,687 --> 00:41:34,918
- Where are you going?
- You'll see. In the shed.

515
00:41:35,087 --> 00:41:39,524
'Pon my soul, Doctor.
It's one riddle after another with you.

516
00:41:39,687 --> 00:41:45,205
After all these revelations,
there's one mystery you still haven't explained.

517
00:41:45,367 --> 00:41:48,962
Answer me this... Who are you?

518
00:41:52,967 --> 00:41:55,322
Just a friend, passing through.

519
00:41:55,487 --> 00:41:58,604
But you have such knowledge
of future times...

520
00:41:58,767 --> 00:42:01,998
I don't wish to impose on you,
but I must ask you.

521
00:42:03,007 --> 00:42:07,398
My books, Doctor...do they last?

522
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:09,125
Oh, yes.

523
00:42:10,207 --> 00:42:13,085
- For how long?
- Forever.

524
00:42:17,247 --> 00:42:20,364
Right. Shed. Come on, Rose.

525
00:42:21,367 --> 00:42:23,881
In the box? Both of you?

526
00:42:24,047 --> 00:42:26,561
Down, boy. See you.

527
00:42:30,407 --> 00:42:33,683
Doesn't it change history
if he writes about blue ghosts?

528
00:42:33,847 --> 00:42:39,160
In a week it's 1870 and that's the year he dies.
He'll never get to tell his story.

529
00:42:39,327 --> 00:42:41,841
Oh, no. He was so nice.

530
00:42:42,007 --> 00:42:45,124
In your time he was dead.
We've brought him back to life.

531
00:42:45,287 --> 00:42:50,759
He's more alive now than he's ever been.
Let's give him one last surprise.
