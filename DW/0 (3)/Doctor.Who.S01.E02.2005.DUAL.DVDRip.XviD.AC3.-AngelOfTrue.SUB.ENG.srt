My name's Rose. That's a sort of plant.

Aye, aye.

You look at 'em and they're alien.

- No.

All the same,
we respect the Earth as family.

So many species evolved from that planet.
Mankind is only one. I'm another.

Perhaps you could tell a story or two.

Perhaps a man only enjoys trouble
when there's nothing else left.

00:25:54,447 --> 00:25:56,483
I scanned you earlier.

Forgive me for intruding
but it's remarkable that you even exist.

00:42:47,007 --> 00:42:48,998
I don't know...

496
00:42:50,087 --> 00:42:51,884
I want...

497
00:42:54,807 --> 00:42:58,641
- Can you smell chips?
- Yeah.

498
00:42:58,807 --> 00:43:01,037
- Yeah.
- I want chips.

499
00:43:01,207 --> 00:43:03,038
Me too.

500
00:43:03,207 --> 00:43:05,482
Chips it is, and you can pay.

501
00:43:06,567 --> 00:43:09,161
- No money.
- What sort of date are you?

502
00:43:09,327 --> 00:43:12,285
Come on, tight-wad. Chips are on me.

503
00:43:12,447 --> 00:43:15,917
We've only got five billion years
till the shops close.

504
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:30,004
Let's have a look at the past.
1860. How does 1860 sound?

505
00:43:30,167 --> 00:43:32,840
- What happened in 1860?
- Let's find out.

506
00:43:34,447 --> 00:43:39,237
- I can't believe she's gone.
- Not gone, Mr Redpath. Merely sleeping.

507
00:43:40,527 --> 00:43:45,726
- She's on her feet and out there somewhere.
- For shame! It's ungodly.

508
00:43:46,727 --> 00:43:48,877
Mr Dickens, this is your call.

509
00:43:49,047 --> 00:43:53,598
Use the sight.
Find the old lady or you're dismissed.

510
00:43:55,047 --> 00:43:58,437
What phantasmagoria is this?

511
00:43:58,607 --> 00:44:00,882
- (SCREAMING)
- That's more like it.
