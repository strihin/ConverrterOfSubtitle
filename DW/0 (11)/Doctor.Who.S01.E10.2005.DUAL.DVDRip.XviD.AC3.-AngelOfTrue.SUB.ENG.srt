(ALL) Mummy! Mummy!

172
00:10:36,462 --> 00:10:38,418
It's keeping us here till it can get at us.

173
00:10:38,502 --> 00:10:40,333
-It's controlling them?
-It is them.

174
00:10:40,422 --> 00:10:42,413
It's every living thing in this hospital.

175
00:10:42,502 --> 00:10:44,458
Okay. This can function
as a sonic blaster,

176
00:10:44,542 --> 00:10:47,659
a sonic cannon and it's a triple-enfolded
sonic disruptor.

177
00:10:47,742 --> 00:10:50,734
-Doc, what you got?
-I've got a sonic.... Never mind.

178
00:10:50,822 --> 00:10:53,097
-What?
-It's sonic, okay? Let's leave it at that.

179
00:10:53,182 --> 00:10:54,774
Disruptor? Cannon? What?

180
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:57,296
It's sonic, totally sonic. I am soniced up.

181
00:10:57,382 --> 00:11:00,180
-A sonic what?
-Screwdriver!

182
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,021
Going down.

183
00:11:10,622 --> 00:11:12,260
Doctor, are you okay?

184
00:11:12,342 --> 00:11:14,810
-Could've used a warning.
-The gratitude.

185
00:11:14,902 --> 00:11:16,972
-Who has a sonic screwdriver?
-I do.

186
00:11:17,062 --> 00:11:18,336
Lights?

187
00:11:18,422 --> 00:11:21,255
Who looks at a screwdriver and thinks,
''Ooh, this could be more sonic?''

188
00:11:21,342 --> 00:11:23,902
-You've never been bored?
-There's got to be a light switch.

189
00:11:23,982 --> 00:11:27,054
Never had a long night?
Never had a lot of cabinets to put up?

190
00:11:27,262 --> 00:11:28,934
-Mummy.
-Mummy.

191
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,216
Door.

192
00:11:34,302 --> 00:11:35,530
-Damn it!
-Mummy?

193
00:11:35,622 --> 00:11:38,056
It's the special features,
they really drain the battery.

194
00:11:38,142 --> 00:11:39,461
The battery?

195
00:11:41,062 --> 00:11:42,415
It's so lame.

196
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:46,051
I was going to send for another one but
somebody's got to blow up the factory.

197
00:11:46,142 --> 00:11:48,053
I know. First day I met him,
he blew my job up.

198
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:49,655
That's practically how he communicates.

199
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,380
Okay, that door should hold it for a bit.

200
00:11:51,462 --> 00:11:54,260
-The door? The wall didn't stop it.
-It's got to find us first!

201
00:11:54,342 --> 00:11:56,492
Come on, we're not done yet. Assets.

202
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:59,654
I've got a banana and, in a pinch,
you could put up some shelves.

203
00:11:59,742 --> 00:12:02,176
-Window?
-Barred. Sheer drop. Seven storeys.

204
00:12:02,262 --> 00:12:03,456
And no other exits.

205
00:12:03,542 --> 00:12:06,852
The assets conversation went in a flash,
didn't it?

206
00:12:07,622 --> 00:12:09,692
-Where'd you pick this one up, then?
-Doctor.

207
00:12:09,782 --> 00:12:12,899
She was hanging from a barrage balloon,
I had an invisible spaceship.

208
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,734
I never stood a chance.

209
00:12:14,822 --> 00:12:16,540
Okay. One, we've got to get out of here.

210
00:12:16,622 --> 00:12:19,182
Two, we can't get out of here.
Have I missed anything?

211
00:12:20,102 --> 00:12:23,014
Yeah. Jack just disappeared.

212
00:12:32,742 --> 00:12:35,620
I thought as much.
What are all of you doing here?

213
00:12:35,742 --> 00:12:37,653
Different house every night I told you.

214
00:12:37,742 --> 00:12:40,210
We thought you were dead.
Or you'd run off.

215
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:42,577
I didn't. I knew you'd come back for us.

216
00:12:47,742 --> 00:12:49,539
Found that old thing in the junk.

217
00:12:49,622 --> 00:12:52,090
-Thinks he's can write now.
-Writing a letter to me dad.

218
00:12:52,182 --> 00:12:54,901
You don't even know where your dad is.
How you gonna send it?

219
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:58,054
-I don't know, stick it in an envelope.
-You can't even read or write.

220
00:12:58,142 --> 00:12:59,939
I don't need to, I've got a machine.

221
00:13:00,022 --> 00:13:02,138
Will you stop making that noise?

222
00:13:06,422 --> 00:13:07,775
I'm sorry, Jim.

223
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:12,212
On you go, you write a letter
to your dad if you want to.

224
00:13:17,782 --> 00:13:19,693
I know we should
have went somewhere else

225
00:13:19,782 --> 00:13:22,012
but we need you, see, for the thinking.

226
00:13:22,542 --> 00:13:24,453
What if I wasn't here?

227
00:13:24,542 --> 00:13:26,851
What if one night
I didn't come back for you?

228
00:13:26,942 --> 00:13:29,581
There's a war on, people go out.

229
00:13:29,662 --> 00:13:31,857
They don't always come back. It happens.

230
00:13:32,902 --> 00:13:34,335
What would you do then?

231
00:13:41,102 --> 00:13:43,218
They're wire cutters.

232
00:13:43,302 --> 00:13:45,258
I need you to think about that.

233
00:13:45,342 --> 00:13:49,255
-Someone's got to look after this lot.
-Why? Are you going somewhere?

234
00:13:51,342 --> 00:13:54,459
The bomb site.
The one at the railway station.

235
00:13:54,702 --> 00:13:56,693
-Why?
-The child.

236
00:13:58,662 --> 00:14:00,254
That's where he was killed.

237
00:14:00,342 --> 00:14:02,936
That's where it all started.
And I'm gonna find out how.

238
00:14:03,022 --> 00:14:05,172
-He'll get you.
-And then he'll come for us.

239
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:09,141
-He always comes for us.
-No, Ernie, he doesn't.

240
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,252
He always comes after me.

241
00:14:12,942 --> 00:14:16,730
There are things I haven't told you.
Things I can't tell you.

242
00:14:18,062 --> 00:14:22,180
As long as you're with me,
you're in danger.

243
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:24,901
Even right now. Sitting here.
You're in danger because of me.

244
00:14:24,982 --> 00:14:27,098
You're the one that keeps us safe.

245
00:14:27,182 --> 00:14:29,980
You think so, Ernie? Then answer this.

246
00:14:31,862 --> 00:14:34,330
Jim is sitting there right next to you.

247
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:37,695
So who's typing?

248
00:14:56,742 --> 00:14:57,970
Is he coming?

249
00:14:58,062 --> 00:15:02,021
Ernie, as long as you're with me,
he's always coming.

250
00:15:04,102 --> 00:15:06,457
Plenty of greens. And chew your food.

251
00:15:16,742 --> 00:15:18,494
Okay, so he's vanished into thin air.

252
00:15:18,582 --> 00:15:21,301
Why is it always the great-looking ones
who do that?

253
00:15:21,382 --> 00:15:25,739
-I'm making an effort not to be insulted.
-I mean, men.

254
00:15:26,022 --> 00:15:28,217
Okay, thanks, that really helped.

257
00:15:31,622 --> 00:15:33,374
Back on my ship.

258
00:15:33,462 --> 00:15:36,454
Used the emergency teleport.
Sorry I couldn't take you.

259
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:39,136
<i>It's security-keyed</i>
<i>to my molecular structure.</i>

260
00:15:39,342 --> 00:15:40,900
I'm working on it, hang in there.

261
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:42,335
How are you speaking to us?

262
00:15:42,422 --> 00:15:44,652
<i>0m-Com. I can call anything</i>
<i>with a speaker grill.</i>

263
00:15:44,742 --> 00:15:46,858
-Now there's a coincidence.
<i>-What Is?</i>

264
00:15:46,942 --> 00:15:49,536
-The child can Om-Com, too.
-He can?

265
00:15:49,702 --> 00:15:52,341
Anything with a speaker grill.
Even the Tardis phone.

266
00:15:52,422 --> 00:15:54,219
What, you mean the child can phone us?

267
00:15:54,302 --> 00:15:58,693
<i>And I can hear you. Coming to find you.</i>

268
00:15:58,782 --> 00:16:01,376
<i>Coming to find you.</i>

269
00:16:01,462 --> 00:16:03,373
-Doctor, can you hear that?
<i>-Loud and clear.</i>

270
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,771
I'll try to block out the signal.
Least I can do.

271
00:16:05,862 --> 00:16:07,534
<i>Coming to find you, Mummy.</i>

272
00:16:07,622 --> 00:16:09,578
Remember this one, Rose?

00:16:15,702 --> 00:16:17,374
Our song.

00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:04,537
What you doing?

276
00:17:04,622 --> 00:17:08,217
Trying to set up a resonation pattern
in the concrete, loosen the bars.

277
00:17:08,342 --> 00:17:12,415
-Do you think he's coming back?
-Wouldn't bet my life.

278
00:17:12,502 --> 00:17:13,730
Why don't you trust him?

279
00:17:13,822 --> 00:17:16,097
-Why do you?
-Saved my life.

280
00:17:16,182 --> 00:17:18,650
Bloke-wise, that's up there with flossing.

281
00:17:22,102 --> 00:17:26,493
I trust him because he's like you.
Except with dating and dancing.

282
00:17:30,302 --> 00:17:31,860
-What?
-You just assume I'm....

283
00:17:31,942 --> 00:17:35,173
-What?
-You just assume I don't dance.

284
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:37,856
What? Are you telling me you do dance?

285
00:17:37,942 --> 00:17:40,058
900 years old, me.
I've been around a bit.

286
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,337
I think you can assume at some point
I've danced.

287
00:17:42,422 --> 00:17:44,174
-You?
-Problem?

288
00:17:44,262 --> 00:17:47,140
Doesn't the universe implode
or something if you dance?

289
00:17:47,222 --> 00:17:49,816
Well, I've got the moves
but I wouldn't want to boast.

290

(STILL PLAYING MOONLIGHT SERENADE)

Show me your moves.

00:18:07,702 --> 00:18:10,262
Rose, I'm trying to resonate concrete.

293
00:18:10,342 --> 00:18:13,095
Jack will be back. He'll get us out.
So come on.

294
00:18:13,182 --> 00:18:15,935
The world doesn't end
because the Doctor dances.

295
00:18:24,822 --> 00:18:27,461
-Barrage balloon?
-What?

296
00:18:28,062 --> 00:18:29,893
You were hanging
from a barrage balloon.

297
00:18:29,982 --> 00:18:33,133
Oh. Yeah.
About two minutes after you left me.

298
00:18:33,222 --> 00:18:35,895
Thousands of feet above London,
middle of a German air raid,

299
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:37,574
Union Jack all over my chest.

300
00:18:37,662 --> 00:18:39,141
I've travelled with a lot of people

301
00:18:39,222 --> 00:18:41,816
but you're setting new records
for jeopardy friendly.

302
00:18:42,502 --> 00:18:44,811
Is this you dancing?
Because I've got notes.

303
00:18:44,902 --> 00:18:47,621
Hanging from a rope,
thousands of feet above London.

304
00:18:47,782 --> 00:18:49,659
Not a cut, not a bruise.

305
00:18:49,742 --> 00:18:51,619
Yeah, I know. Captain Jack fixed me up.

306
00:18:51,702 --> 00:18:53,374
We're calling him Captain Jack now,
are we?

307
00:18:53,462 --> 00:18:55,976
His name's Jack and he's a captain.

308
00:18:56,062 --> 00:18:59,259
-He's not really a captain, Rose.
-Do you know what I think?

309
00:19:00,022 --> 00:19:02,775
I think you're experiencing captain-envy.

310
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:06,297
You will find your feet
at the end of your legs.

311
00:19:06,382 --> 00:19:07,735
You may care to move them.

312
00:19:07,822 --> 00:19:09,699
If ever he was a captain,
he's been defrocked.

313
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:12,979
-Yeah? Shame I missed that.
-Actually, I quit.

314

Nobody takes my frock.

315
00:19:15,942 --> 00:19:18,456

when they've been teleported.

You guys are so sweet.

317
00:19:20,502 --> 00:19:21,776
Sorry about the delay.

318
00:19:21,862 --> 00:19:24,820
Had to take the Nav-Com off-line
to override the teleport security.

319
00:19:24,902 --> 00:19:27,291
You can spend 1 0 minutes
overriding your own protocols.

320
00:19:27,382 --> 00:19:29,338
Maybe you should remember
whose ship it is.

321
00:19:29,662 --> 00:19:32,176
I do. She was gorgeous.

322
00:19:32,262 --> 00:19:35,060
Like I told her, be back in five minutes.

323
00:19:36,102 --> 00:19:39,936
-This is a Chula ship.
-Yeah, just like that medical transporter.

324
00:19:40,022 --> 00:19:41,819
Only this one is dangerous.

325
00:19:43,102 --> 00:19:45,377
They're what fixed up my hands up.
Jack called them....

326
00:19:45,462 --> 00:19:47,339
-Nanobots? Nanogenes?
-Nanogenes, yeah.

327
00:19:47,422 --> 00:19:50,539
Subatomic robots.
There are millions of them in here. See?

328
00:19:50,662 --> 00:19:53,495
Burned my hand on the console
when we landed. All better now.

329
00:19:53,582 --> 00:19:55,379
They activate

00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:57,851
Check you out for damage,
fix any physical flaws.

331
00:19:59,822 --> 00:20:02,655
Take us to the crash site.
I need to see your space junk.

332
00:20:02,742 --> 00:20:06,530
Soon as I get the Nav-Com back online.
Make yourself comfortable.

333
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,739
Carry on with whatever it was
you were doing.

334
00:20:09,822 --> 00:20:12,620
-We were talking about dancing.
-It didn't look like talking.

335
00:20:12,702 --> 00:20:14,579
Didn't feel like dancing.

336
00:20:31,302 --> 00:20:33,179
Halt! Don't move!

337
00:20:36,822 --> 00:20:40,258
So, you used to be a Time Agent
and now you're trying to con them?

338
00:20:40,342 --> 00:20:42,810
If it makes me sound any better,
it's not for the money.

339
00:20:42,902 --> 00:20:44,415
For what?

340
00:20:44,502 --> 00:20:47,096
Woke up one morning
when I was still working for them,

341
00:20:47,182 --> 00:20:49,412
found they'd stolen two years
of my memories.

342
00:20:49,502 --> 00:20:52,494
-I'd like them back.
-They stole your memories?

343
00:20:52,582 --> 00:20:55,221
Two years of my life. No idea what I did.

344
00:20:56,022 --> 00:21:00,493
Your friend over there doesn't trust me.
And for all I know, he's right not to.

345
00:21:01,462 --> 00:21:05,296
Okay. We're good to go. The crash site?

346
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:10,452
-As you were. You feeling any better?
-Just a touch, sir.

347
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:13,257
Chain her up
where Jenkins can keep an eye on her.

348
00:21:13,342 --> 00:21:15,572
No. Not in here. Not with him.

349
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:18,615
You shouldn't have broken in here
if you didn't want to stay.

350
00:21:18,702 --> 00:21:20,897
You don't understand. Not with him.

351
00:21:20,982 --> 00:21:23,212
This is a restricted area, miss.

352
00:21:23,302 --> 00:21:25,133
You can just sit here for a bit.

353
00:21:25,222 --> 00:21:27,531
We're going to have to ask you
a few questions.

354
00:21:27,622 --> 00:21:28,896
Found these, sir.

355
00:21:29,942 --> 00:21:33,412
Very professional,
a little bit too professional.

356
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:35,538
Didn't just drop in by accident then,
did you?

357
00:21:35,622 --> 00:21:37,260
My little brother died here.

358
00:21:37,342 --> 00:21:39,412
I wanted to find out what killed him.

359
00:21:39,502 --> 00:21:41,891
Take the men, check the fence
for any other breaches.

360
00:21:41,982 --> 00:21:44,701
And search the area,
she may not have come here alone.

361
00:21:44,782 --> 00:21:46,374
-Yes, sir!
-Please.

362
00:21:46,462 --> 00:21:48,373
Listen, you can't leave me here.

363
00:21:48,462 --> 00:21:50,657
-Watch her, Jenkins.
-Yes, Mummy.

364
00:21:52,422 --> 00:21:54,333
-Jenkins?
-Sorry.

365
00:21:54,942 --> 00:21:57,172
Sir, I don't know
what's the matter with me.

366
00:21:57,342 --> 00:22:01,460
Look, lock me up, fine, but not here.
Please, anywhere but here.

367
00:22:03,342 --> 00:22:06,573
You'll be all right, miss.
I'm just a little....

368
00:22:07,422 --> 00:22:09,731
Just a little....

369
00:22:09,822 --> 00:22:11,175
What's the matter with you?

370
00:22:11,262 --> 00:22:14,493
-Please, let me go.
-Why would I do that?

371
00:22:14,582 --> 00:22:16,698
Because you've got a scar
on the back of your hand.

372
00:22:16,782 --> 00:22:19,216
Yes, but I don't see what that's got to do
with anything.

373
00:22:19,302 --> 00:22:20,655
You feel like you're gonna be sick.

374
00:22:20,742 --> 00:22:23,017
Like something's forcing its way up
your throat.

375
00:22:23,142 --> 00:22:25,610
I know because I've seen it before.

376
00:22:25,782 --> 00:22:29,536
-What's happening to me?
-In a minute you won't be you anymore.

377
00:22:29,822 --> 00:22:31,619
You won't even remember you.

378
00:22:31,702 --> 00:22:35,012
And unless you let me go,
it's going to happen to me, too.

379
00:22:35,102 --> 00:22:37,218
-Please.
-What are you talking about?

380
00:22:37,302 --> 00:22:39,611
-What's your mother's name?
-Matilda.

381
00:22:39,702 --> 00:22:41,260
-You got a wife?
-Yes.

382
00:22:41,342 --> 00:22:42,775
Wife's name?

383
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:45,979
You got kids? What's your name?

384
00:22:47,342 --> 00:22:51,415
Please, let me go. It's too late for you.
I'm sorry.

385
00:22:51,502 --> 00:22:53,493
But please let me go.

386
00:22:55,022 --> 00:22:56,819
What....

387
00:22:57,262 --> 00:22:59,981
Mummy!

388
00:23:12,382 --> 00:23:13,701
There it is.

389
00:23:14,382 --> 00:23:17,294
They've got Algy on duty.
Must be important.

390
00:23:17,382 --> 00:23:19,054
We've got to get past him.

391
00:23:19,142 --> 00:23:22,373
Are the words ''distract the guard''
heading in my general direction?

392
00:23:22,462 --> 00:23:24,532
I don't think that'd be such a good idea.

393
00:23:24,622 --> 00:23:26,374
Don't worry, I can handle it.

394
00:23:26,462 --> 00:23:29,101
I've got to know Algy quite well
since I've been in town.

395
00:23:29,182 --> 00:23:31,412
Trust me, you're not his type.

396
00:23:32,142 --> 00:23:33,495
I'll distract him.

397
00:23:35,742 --> 00:23:37,061
Don't wait up.

398
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,538
Relax. He's a 51st century guy.

399
00:23:42,622 --> 00:23:45,295
He's just a bit more flexible
when it comes to dancing.

400
00:23:45,862 --> 00:23:47,295
How flexible?

401
00:23:47,382 --> 00:23:50,055
By his time, you lot are spread out across
half the galaxy.

402
00:23:50,142 --> 00:23:53,373
-Meaning?
-So many species, so little time.

403
00:23:53,462 --> 00:23:55,532
What, that's what we do
when we get out there?

404
00:23:55,622 --> 00:23:58,455
That's our mission?
We seek new life and....

405
00:23:59,862 --> 00:24:01,090
Dance.

406
00:24:06,222 --> 00:24:08,258
Hey, tiger. How's it hanging?

407
00:24:11,662 --> 00:24:13,732
-Mummy?
-Algy, old sport, it's me.

408
00:24:14,822 --> 00:24:17,177
-Mummy?
-It's me, Jack.

409
00:24:17,382 --> 00:24:18,576
Jack?

410
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:22,618
Are you my mummy?

411
00:24:37,822 --> 00:24:40,620
Stay back! You men, stay away.

412
00:24:45,342 --> 00:24:47,902
The effect's becoming airborne,
accelerating.

413
00:24:48,022 --> 00:24:50,092
-What's keeping us safe?
-Nothing.

414
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:52,697
-Here they come again.
-All we need.

415
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:54,374
(SIRENS WAILING)

416
00:24:54,462 --> 00:24:56,851
Didn't you say a bomb
was gonna land here?

417
00:24:56,942 --> 00:24:58,295
Never mind about that.

418
00:24:58,382 --> 00:25:00,577
If the contaminant's airborne now,
there's hours left.

419
00:25:00,662 --> 00:25:01,811
-Till what?
-Till nothing.

420
00:25:01,902 --> 00:25:03,893
Forever. For the entire human race.

421
00:25:03,982 --> 00:25:05,540
And can anyone else hear singing?

422
00:25:05,622 --> 00:25:07,101
<i>#</i> ...the tree tops

423
00:25:07,182 --> 00:25:10,492
<i>#</i> When the wind blows
the cradle will rock

424
00:25:11,462 --> 00:25:14,738
<i>#</i> When the bow breaks
the cradle will fall

425
00:25:15,262 --> 00:25:18,379
<i>#</i> Down will come baby cradle and all

426
00:25:22,822 --> 00:25:26,371
<i>#</i> Rock-a-bye baby on the tree tops

427
00:25:27,222 --> 00:25:30,214
<i>#</i> When the wind blows
the cradle will rock <i>#</i>

428
00:25:40,342 --> 00:25:42,333
You see? Just an ambulance.

429
00:25:42,702 --> 00:25:44,215
That's an ambulance?

430
00:25:44,302 --> 00:25:47,977
It's hard to explain.
It's from another world.

431
00:25:48,182 --> 00:25:50,412
-They've been trying to get in.
-Of course they have.

432
00:25:50,502 --> 00:25:53,494
They think they've got their hands
on Hitler's latest secret weapon.

433
00:25:53,582 --> 00:25:56,142
-What are you doing?
-The sooner you see this thing's empty,

434
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:58,372
the sooner you'll know
I had nothing to do with it.

435
00:26:01,342 --> 00:26:02,536
Didn't happen last time.

436
00:26:02,622 --> 00:26:05,261
It hadn't crashed last time.
There'll be emergency protocols.

437
00:26:05,342 --> 00:26:07,139
Doctor, what is that?

438
00:26:12,422 --> 00:26:13,537
Mummy.

439
00:26:25,182 --> 00:26:26,376
Doctor!

440
00:26:28,782 --> 00:26:30,534
-Captain, secure those gates.
-Why?

441
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:32,977
Just do it!

442
00:26:33,062 --> 00:26:34,654
Nancy, how did you get in here?

443
00:26:34,742 --> 00:26:36,573
-I cut the wire.
-Show Rose.

444
00:26:36,662 --> 00:26:38,812
Setting 2,428-D.

445
00:26:38,902 --> 00:26:41,416
-What?
-Reattaches barbed wire. Go!

446
00:26:59,542 --> 00:27:01,897
Who are you? Who are any of you?

447
00:27:02,542 --> 00:27:04,134
Never believe me if I told you.

448
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:06,816
You just told me that was an ambulance
from another world.

449
00:27:06,902 --> 00:27:10,099
There are people running round with
gas masks calling for their mummies

450
00:27:10,182 --> 00:27:12,742
and the sky's full of Germans
dropping bombs on me.

451
00:27:12,822 --> 00:27:16,132
Tell me, do you think there's anything
left I couldn't believe?

452
00:27:17,662 --> 00:27:20,051
We're time travellers. From the future.

453
00:27:20,142 --> 00:27:23,532
-Mad, you are!
-We have a time travel machine.

454
00:27:23,622 --> 00:27:27,581
It's not that. All right,
you got a time travel machine.

455
00:27:27,982 --> 00:27:30,450
I'll believe you. Believe anything, me.

456
00:27:32,182 --> 00:27:33,979
But what future?

457
00:27:37,742 --> 00:27:40,256
Nancy, this isn't the end.

458
00:27:40,342 --> 00:27:43,379
I know how it looks, it's not the end
of the world or anything.

459
00:27:43,462 --> 00:27:46,181
How can you say that? Look at it.

460
00:27:46,262 --> 00:27:49,060
Listen to me. I was born in this city.

461
00:27:49,142 --> 00:27:51,736
I'm from here, in like 50 years' time.

462
00:27:51,822 --> 00:27:53,972
-From here?
-I'm a Londoner.

463
00:27:54,662 --> 00:27:57,972
-From your future.
-But....

464
00:27:58,062 --> 00:28:00,371
-But you're not....
-What?

465
00:28:00,462 --> 00:28:02,612
-German?
-Nancy.

466
00:28:02,702 --> 00:28:05,580
The Germans don't come here.
They don't win.

467
00:28:06,302 --> 00:28:09,612
Don't tell anyone I told you so.
But you know what?

468
00:28:10,262 --> 00:28:12,696
-You win.
-We win?

469
00:28:14,662 --> 00:28:15,936
Come on.

470
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:19,334
It's empty. Look at it.

471
00:28:19,422 --> 00:28:22,095
What do you expect
in a Chula medical transporter?

472
00:28:22,182 --> 00:28:23,979
Bandages? Cough drops?

473
00:28:24,062 --> 00:28:26,212
-Rose?
-I don't know.

474
00:28:26,502 --> 00:28:28,857
-Yes, you do.
-Nanogenes!

475
00:28:28,942 --> 00:28:30,978
It wasn't empty, Captain.

476
00:28:31,302 --> 00:28:34,533
There was enough nanogenes in there
to rebuild a species.

477
00:28:35,222 --> 00:28:37,690
-Oh, God.
-Getting it now, are we?

478
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:39,852
When the ship crashes,
the nanogenes escape.

479
00:28:39,942 --> 00:28:41,500
Billions upon billions of them.

480
00:28:41,582 --> 00:28:44,460
Ready to fix all the cuts and bruises
in the whole world.

481
00:28:44,542 --> 00:28:47,056
But what they find first is a dead child.

482
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:50,214
Probably killed earlier that night.
And wearing a gas mask.

483
00:28:50,302 --> 00:28:52,896
And they brought him back to life?
They can do that?

484
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:55,735
What's life? Life's easy.
A quirk of matter.

485
00:28:55,822 --> 00:28:59,132
Nature's way of keeping meat fresh.
Nothing to a nanogene.

486
00:28:59,222 --> 00:29:00,450
One problem, though.

487
00:29:00,542 --> 00:29:03,010
These nanogenes,
they're not like the ones on your ship.

488
00:29:03,102 --> 00:29:05,172
This lot have never seen
a human being before.

489
00:29:05,262 --> 00:29:07,730
Don't know what a human being's
supposed to look like.

490
00:29:07,822 --> 00:29:11,451
All they've got to go on is one little
body, and there's not a lot left.

491
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:12,657
But they carry right on.

492
00:29:12,742 --> 00:29:15,131
They do what they're programmed to,
they patch it up.

493
00:29:15,222 --> 00:29:18,180
Can't tell what's gas mask
and what's skull, but they do their best.

494
00:29:18,262 --> 00:29:20,822
And then off they fly, off they go,
work to be done.

495
00:29:20,902 --> 00:29:23,939
'Cause you see, now they think
they know what people should look like.

496
00:29:24,022 --> 00:29:26,741
And it's time to fix all the rest.
And they won't ever stop.

497
00:29:26,822 --> 00:29:28,335
They won't ever stop.

498
00:29:28,422 --> 00:29:31,095
The entire human race
is gonna be torn down

499
00:29:31,182 --> 00:29:35,016
and rebuilt in the form of
one terrified child looking for its mother.

500
00:29:35,102 --> 00:29:38,014
-And nothing in the world can stop it!
-I didn't know.

501
00:29:53,222 --> 00:29:54,450
Mummy.

502
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:55,691
Rose?

503
00:30:00,742 --> 00:30:03,814
Mummy. Mummy....

504
00:30:09,982 --> 00:30:11,973
It's bringing the gas mask people here,
isn't it?

505
00:30:12,062 --> 00:30:16,021
The ship thinks it's under attack. It's
calling up the troops. Standard protocol.

506
00:30:16,102 --> 00:30:18,093
But the gas mask people aren't troops!

507
00:30:18,182 --> 00:30:20,252
They are now.
This is a battlefield ambulance.

508
00:30:20,342 --> 00:30:23,698
The nanogenes don't just fix you up,
they get you ready for the frontline.

509
00:30:23,782 --> 00:30:26,933
-Equip you, programme you.
-That's why the child's so strong?

510
00:30:27,022 --> 00:30:31,334
-Why it could do that phoning thing?
-It's a fully equipped Chula warrior, yes.

511
00:30:31,422 --> 00:30:34,334
All that weapons tech in the hands
of an hysterical four-year-old

512
00:30:34,422 --> 00:30:37,778
looking for his mummy
and now there's an army of them.

513
00:30:37,862 --> 00:30:40,012
Mummy. Mummy.

514
00:30:41,782 --> 00:30:43,181
Why don't they attack?

515
00:30:43,262 --> 00:30:46,254
Good little soldiers.
Waiting for their commander.

516
00:30:46,342 --> 00:30:48,333
The child?

517
00:30:48,422 --> 00:30:49,901
-Jamie.
-What?

518
00:30:50,502 --> 00:30:52,493
Not the child. Jamie.

519
00:30:52,902 --> 00:30:55,416
-So how long until the bomb falls?
-Any second.

520
00:30:55,502 --> 00:30:58,733
What's the matter, Captain?
Bit close to the volcano for you?

521
00:30:58,822 --> 00:31:00,574
-He's just a little boy.
-I know.

522
00:31:00,662 --> 00:31:03,699
-He's just a boy who wants his mummy.
-I know.

523
00:31:05,302 --> 00:31:06,621
There isn't a little boy born

524
00:31:06,702 --> 00:31:09,500
who wouldn't tear the world apart
to save his mummy.

525
00:31:10,182 --> 00:31:13,492
-And this little boy can.
-So what are we gonna do?

526
00:31:14,222 --> 00:31:15,701
I don't know.

527
00:31:17,142 --> 00:31:19,702
-It's my fault.
-No.

528
00:31:19,782 --> 00:31:21,977
-It is. It's all my fault.
-How can it be your....

529
00:31:22,062 --> 00:31:25,020
Mummy. Mummy.

530
00:31:26,422 --> 00:31:28,299
-Mummy
-Mummy!

531
00:31:28,422 --> 00:31:29,935
Mummy!

532
00:31:36,382 --> 00:31:38,020
Nancy, what age are you?

533
00:31:39,782 --> 00:31:42,774
20? 21 ? Older than you look, yes?

534
00:31:45,182 --> 00:31:47,821
Doctor, that bomb, we've got seconds.

535
00:31:48,982 --> 00:31:51,371
-You can teleport us out.
-Not you guys.

536
00:31:51,462 --> 00:31:53,100
The Nav-Com's back online.

537
00:31:53,182 --> 00:31:55,252
Gonna take too long
to override the protocols.

538
00:31:55,342 --> 00:31:57,981
So it's Volcano Day.
Do what you've got to do.

539
00:31:58,062 --> 00:31:59,211
Jack?

540
00:32:04,262 --> 00:32:07,060
How old were you five years ago?
1 5? 1 6?

541
00:32:07,622 --> 00:32:09,852
Old enough to give birth, anyway.

542
00:32:11,742 --> 00:32:13,972
He's not your brother, is he?

543
00:32:15,702 --> 00:32:18,011
A teenage single mother in 1 941 .

544
00:32:18,942 --> 00:32:21,217
So you hid. You lied.

545
00:32:22,262 --> 00:32:24,093
You even lied to him.

546
00:32:28,742 --> 00:32:30,334
Are you my mummy?

547
00:32:31,902 --> 00:32:33,893
He's gonna keep asking, Nancy.

548
00:32:33,982 --> 00:32:36,257
-He's never gonna stop.
-Mummy.

549
00:32:36,782 --> 00:32:38,101
Tell him.

550
00:32:40,822 --> 00:32:45,213
Nancy, the future of the human race
is in your hands.

551
00:32:45,302 --> 00:32:47,338
Trust me and tell him.

552
00:32:50,102 --> 00:32:52,570
Are you my mummy?

553
00:32:54,862 --> 00:32:56,580
Are you my mummy?

554
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,700
Are you my mummy?

555
00:32:59,782 --> 00:33:04,298
-Yes, I am your mummy.
-Mummy?

556
00:33:06,062 --> 00:33:09,532
-I'm here.
-Are you my mummy?

557
00:33:13,342 --> 00:33:14,821
I'm here.

558
00:33:14,902 --> 00:33:17,496
-Are you my mummy?
-Yes.

559
00:33:17,582 --> 00:33:18,901
Are you my mummy?

560
00:33:18,982 --> 00:33:21,621
He doesn't understand,
there's not enough of him left.

561
00:33:23,942 --> 00:33:28,572
I am your mummy.
I will always be your mummy.

562
00:33:30,142 --> 00:33:31,621
I'm so sorry.

563
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:35,941
I'm so, so sorry.

564
00:33:38,582 --> 00:33:40,220
What's happening?

565
00:33:42,942 --> 00:33:44,819
-Doctor, it's changing her, we should....
-Shh!

566
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,620
Come on. Please!

567
00:33:48,382 --> 00:33:51,772
Come on, you clever little nanogenes.
Figure it out.

568
00:33:53,102 --> 00:33:55,935
The mother, she's the mother.

569
00:33:56,022 --> 00:33:58,331
It's got to be enough information.
Figure it out.

570
00:33:58,422 --> 00:34:00,378
-What's happening?
-See?

571
00:34:01,302 --> 00:34:03,293
Recognising the same DNA.

572
00:34:11,022 --> 00:34:13,661
Come on. Give me a day like this.

573
00:34:14,422 --> 00:34:16,094
Give me this one.

574
00:34:27,102 --> 00:34:30,981
Welcome back! 20 years to pop music,
you're gonna love it.

575
00:34:31,382 --> 00:34:32,451
What happened?

576
00:34:32,542 --> 00:34:35,932
The nanogenes recognised the superior
information. The parent DNA.

577
00:34:36,022 --> 00:34:38,536
They didn't change you
because you changed them.

578
00:34:39,862 --> 00:34:42,251
-Mother knows best.
-Jamie.

579
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:45,338
-Doctor, that bomb.
-Taken care of it.

580
00:34:45,422 --> 00:34:47,060
-How?
-Psychology.

581
00:34:58,702 --> 00:35:00,818
-Doctor!
-Good lad.

582
00:35:01,022 --> 00:35:05,891
The bomb's already started detonation.
I've put it in stasis, but it won't last!

583
00:35:05,982 --> 00:35:09,531
Change of plan! Don't need the bomb.
Can you get rid of it, safely as you can?

584
00:35:09,622 --> 00:35:11,613
-Rose?
-Yeah?

585
00:35:11,862 --> 00:35:13,136
Goodbye.

586
00:35:16,742 --> 00:35:19,415
By the way. Love the T-shirt!

587
00:35:39,942 --> 00:35:42,502
-What are you doing?
-Software patch.

588
00:35:42,742 --> 00:35:46,212
Gonna email the upgrade.
You want moves, Rose.

589
00:35:46,982 --> 00:35:48,335
I'll give you moves.

590
00:35:58,502 --> 00:36:02,097
Everybody lives, Rose. Just this once!

591
00:36:02,742 --> 00:36:04,414
Everybody lives!

592
00:36:10,342 --> 00:36:13,220
Dr Constantine,
who never left his patients.

593
00:36:13,302 --> 00:36:15,020
Back on your feet, constant doctor.

594
00:36:15,102 --> 00:36:17,172
World doesn't want to get by
without you just yet

595
00:36:17,262 --> 00:36:19,218
and I don't blame it one bit.

596
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:22,055
These are your patients. All better now.

597
00:36:22,302 --> 00:36:24,258
Yes, so it seems.

598
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:27,974
They also seem to be standing around
in a disused railway station.

599
00:36:28,062 --> 00:36:29,734
Is there any particular reason for that?

600
00:36:29,822 --> 00:36:31,301
Yeah, well, you know, cutbacks.

601
00:36:31,382 --> 00:36:33,293
Listen, whatever was wrong
with them in the past

602
00:36:33,382 --> 00:36:35,293
you're probably gonna find
that they're cured.

603
00:36:35,382 --> 00:36:39,057
Just tell them what a great doctor you
are, don't make a big thing of it. Okay?

604
00:36:41,102 --> 00:36:42,933
Dr Constantine.

605
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:46,011
Mrs Harcourt!
How much better you're looking!

606
00:36:46,102 --> 00:36:47,899
My leg's grown back.

607
00:36:48,422 --> 00:36:52,256
When I come to the hospital,
I had one leg.

608
00:36:52,342 --> 00:36:55,971
Well, there is a war on,
is it possible you miscounted?

609
00:36:56,262 --> 00:36:59,777
Right, you lot. Lots to do.
Beat the Germans, save the world.

610
00:36:59,862 --> 00:37:01,853
Don't forget the welfare state!

611
00:37:03,622 --> 00:37:06,455
Setting this to self-destruct,
soon as everybody's clear.

612
00:37:06,542 --> 00:37:08,100
History says there was an explosion here.

613
00:37:08,182 --> 00:37:11,299
-Who am I to argue with history?
-Usually, the first in line.

614
00:37:14,222 --> 00:37:15,780
The nanogenes will clean up the mess

615
00:37:15,862 --> 00:37:18,137
and switch themselves off,
'cause I just told them to.

616
00:37:18,222 --> 00:37:21,100
Nancy and Jamie will go to
Dr Constantine for help, ditto.

617
00:37:21,182 --> 00:37:23,776
All in all, all things considered. Fantastic!

618
00:37:23,862 --> 00:37:25,978
Look at you beaming away
like you're Father Christmas.

619
00:37:26,062 --> 00:37:28,212
Who says I'm not?
Red bicycle when you were 1 2.

620
00:37:28,822 --> 00:37:31,177
-What?
-And everybody lives, Rose.

621
00:37:31,262 --> 00:37:33,822
Everybody lives.
I need more days like this!

622
00:37:33,902 --> 00:37:36,860
-Doctor.
-Go on, ask me anything. I'm on fire.

623
00:37:37,102 --> 00:37:38,376
What about Jack?

624
00:37:39,662 --> 00:37:41,334
Why did he say goodbye?

625
00:37:49,782 --> 00:37:53,058
Okay, computer, how long can we keep
the bomb in stasis?

626

<i>Stasis decaying at 90% cycle.</i>

627
00:37:55,782 --> 00:37:59,297
<i>-Detonation In three minutes.</i>
-Can we jettison it?

628
00:37:59,382 --> 00:38:02,977
<i>Any attempt to jettison the device</i>
<i>will precipitate detonation.</i>

629
00:38:03,062 --> 00:38:07,214
<i>-1 00% probability.</i>
-We could stick it in an escape pod?

630
00:38:07,302 --> 00:38:09,372
<i>There Is no escape pod on board.</i>

631
00:38:09,462 --> 00:38:11,896
Okay, see the flaw in that.
I'll get in the escape pod.

632
00:38:11,982 --> 00:38:14,291
<i>There Is no escape pod on board.</i>

633
00:38:14,382 --> 00:38:16,737
-Did you check everywhere?
<i>-Affirmative.</i>

634
00:38:16,822 --> 00:38:19,052
-Under the sink?
<i>-Affirmative.</i>

635
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:23,491
Okay.

636
00:38:24,022 --> 00:38:26,490
Out of 1 00, exactly how dead am I?

639
00:38:34,022 --> 00:38:36,217
Lovely. Thanks.

640
00:38:37,182 --> 00:38:39,696
-Good to know the numbers.
<i>-You're welcome.</i>

641
00:38:40,382 --> 00:38:42,532
Okay, then!

642
00:38:42,622 --> 00:38:46,331
Think we'd better initiate
emergency protocol 41 7.

643
00:38:46,422 --> 00:38:47,855
<i>Affirmative.</i>

644
00:38:57,262 --> 00:39:00,140
A little too much vermouth.
See if I come here again.

645
00:39:03,302 --> 00:39:04,735
Funny thing.

I ordered four hyper-vodkas

648
00:39:12,422 --> 00:39:14,731
All a bit of a blur after that.

649
00:39:14,982 --> 00:39:17,576
Woke up in bed
with both my executioners.

650
00:39:18,382 --> 00:39:20,942
Lovely couple. They stayed in touch.

651
00:39:21,422 --> 00:39:24,141
Can't say that about most executioners.

652
00:39:27,262 --> 00:39:28,490
Anyway.

653
00:39:30,342 --> 00:39:32,697
Thanks for everything, computer.

654
00:39:33,302 --> 00:39:34,940

Okay, all right and turn.

-I'm sure I used to know this stuff.

660
00:40:19,782 --> 00:40:20,817
Close the door, will you?

661
00:40:20,902 --> 00:40:23,541
Your ship's about to blow up,
there's gonna be a draft.

00:40:28,502 --> 00:40:31,096
-Much bigger on the inside.
-You'd better be.

to say is, you may cut in.

Actually, Doctor,
I thought Jack might like this dance.

669
00:40:48,742 --> 00:40:51,859

00:41:24,062 --> 00:41:24,653
Whoo!

672
00:41:29,942 --> 00:41:32,410
And I was having such a nice day.

673
00:41:33,062 --> 00:41:34,051
According to Intelligence,

674
00:41:34,142 --> 00:41:36,940
the target is the last surviving member
of the Slitheen family.

675
00:41:37,022 --> 00:41:39,536
A criminal sect from the planet
Rexicoricophalvitorius

676
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:42,295
masquerading as a human being,
zipped inside a skin suit.

677
00:41:44,662 --> 00:41:47,859
Its nuclear power station right in
the heart of Cardiff city

678
00:41:47,942 --> 00:41:49,819
will bring jobs for all.

679
00:41:49,902 --> 00:41:52,177
And it just so happens to be
right on top of the rift.

680
00:41:52,262 --> 00:41:55,971
If this power station went into meltdown,
the entire planet would go....

681
00:41:58,222 --> 00:41:59,974
Go on then, run!

682
00:42:00,062 --> 00:42:02,178
It's the rift, the rift's opening.

683
00:42:02,462 --> 00:42:04,134
The whole city's going to disappear!

684
00:42:04,222 --> 00:42:05,701
Time and space are ripping apart.

685
00:42:05,782 --> 00:42:07,932
Never mind Cardiff,
it's going to rip open the planet!
