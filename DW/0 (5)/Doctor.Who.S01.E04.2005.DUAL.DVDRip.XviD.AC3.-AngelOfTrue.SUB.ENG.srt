He's called the Doctor.

326
00:30:20,047 --> 00:30:23,005
It's a box. A blue box.

327
00:30:23,167 --> 00:30:25,362
She called it a Tardis.

of my magnificent ship, would you understand?

- I suppose not.
- Well, shut it, then.

00:31:00,287 --> 00:31:03,518

- He's winding you up.

338

On every street corner.
Looking for a blue box for a whole year.

339
00:31:21,687 --> 00:31:23,678
It's only been a few days for me.

340
00:31:23,847 --> 00:31:30,082
I don't know. It's hard to tell inside this thing,
but I swear, it's just a few days since I left.

341
00:31:32,567 --> 00:31:34,558
Not enough time to miss me, then.

342
00:31:35,487 --> 00:31:37,478
I did miss you.

343
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:44,085
I missed you.

344
00:31:45,887 --> 00:31:47,878
So, um...

345
00:31:48,047 --> 00:31:51,801
In 12 months,
have you been seeing anyone else?

346
00:31:51,967 --> 00:31:54,925
- No.
- OK.

347
00:31:55,087 --> 00:31:58,841
- Mainly 'cause everyone thinks I murdered you.
- Right.

348
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:06,396
So...now that you've come back...

349
00:32:07,607 --> 00:32:10,246

351
00:32:13,887 --> 00:32:19,644

so it followed the flight of that spaceship.

Except... Hold on...

355
00:32:27,927 --> 00:32:31,886
The spaceship did a slingshot
round the Earth before it landed.

356
00:32:32,047 --> 00:32:36,279
It came from Earth in the first place.
It went up and came back down.

The question is, what have they been doing?

359
00:32:50,087 --> 00:32:52,726
